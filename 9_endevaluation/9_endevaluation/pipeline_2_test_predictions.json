    "question": "what is orgasm?",
    "answer": "An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\n\nDictionaries still give the subsidiary meaning, \"a similar point of intensity of emotional excitement,\" but as of 2005 this usage has become obscure. It can be startling to modern readers when encountered in older literature.\n\n\nGeneral\nBoth males and females can experience orgasm, but the exact response varies across gender. Generally speaking, orgasm is the third stage of four in the human sexual response cycle, which is the currently accepted model of the physiological process of sexual stimulation You asked two questions that you might think are the same; but they are not. Orgasm is an experience resulting from the combined effects of physical stimulation, emotional bonding, intellectual intimacy and total surrender or giving to the experience of the moment that crest or climax in overwhelming sensual and spiritual thunderclaps.\n\nMany concepts may play a role in building orgasm, including thinking about making a baby, dominance and submission, etc.\n\nTrue love might be a component of a good orgasm, but is itself different and in the long term more fundamental than the orgasm. Having orgasms with someone you love is wonderful, but the existence of the orgasms does not in and of itself serve to indicate whether the relationship will endure over a long term.",

    "question": "when mutiple women live in the same house for extend periods of time do their periods really start to sycnrani",
    "answer": "Apparently so. they sure do.  and call it a blessing, instead of continuous PMS it's all over at the same time. Yes it is true!  This is what one site had to say:\n\n\"Synchronous menstruation has been observed among mothers, sisters, and daughters who live together, and sometimes among women who simply work together. Of seven female lifeguards who started out one summer with widely scattered periods. Three months later they were all menstruating within four days of one another.\n\nA study of 135 residents of a women's college dorm confirmed the effect. Most of the cycle shifting occurred within the first four months and was usually complete after seven months. Fortunately for the dorm's plumbing, the whole building didn't synchronize, just roommates and close friends. As often as not, the women were unaware of what had happened.  Later research has suggested that synchrony is caused by some sort of scent cue, or pheromone.\" yea they actually do, it's because each woman gives off hormones, and when there are several living together, for a long time, each of their hormones notices the other hormones and their bodies regulates the hormones to all release at the same time because the same \"mechanism\" is controlling all of the women's bodies.  This makes all three human bodies more efficient from the \"mechanisms\" view point. yes and its a bloody mess!!!",

    "question": "how can you releive sciatic pain?",
    "answer": "Manual treatments for sciatica, including physical therapy and specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and manual manipulation (e.g. osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation) to help relieve the pressure on the nerve root, which is the cause of the pain. Medical treatments for sciatica, including medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to help relieve the inflammation, which is usually a component of the pain. Surgery for sciatica, such as microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root. This surgery is designed to help relieve both the pressure and inflammation and may be warranted if the sciatic nerve pain is severe and has not been relieved with appropriate manual or medical treatments. Surgery and meds are the last option IMO! \n\nThe first thing to do is determine the cause and to see if it is true sciatica. Try seeing a Chiropractor. They are excellent at analyzing xrays and will be able to determine why the sciatica is happening and will either refer out or provide treatment. Massage is also great for sciatica & a well trained massage therapist will be able to give you therapeutic exercises to help manage the pain. \n\nThe chiropractor & massage therapist will also be able to give you pointers on lifestyle changes...for sleeping postion, footwear, posture, etc.",

    "question": "Can drinking to many diet cokes cause an ulcer?",
    "answer": "It sure can - read this... it tells you what else can cause ulcers and explains what an ulcer is.  My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.  Our information is not medical advice.  You must see your own doctor for medical advice about your gastro esophageal or ulcers. I don't know...but 8 is TOO MUCH.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is not very sweet in itself, that may be why Equal puts Dextrose (sugar) and maltodextrin as the first ingredients, so that it tastes sweet.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet is a brain drug that stimulates your brain so you think that the food you're eating tastes sweet. If you pay attention you'll notice that when using Aspartame/Nutrasweet, everything you eat at the same time also tastes sweet! This may be why Aspartame/Nutrasweet causes you to crave carbohydrates. Hence, you won't lose weight using it.\nBTW, cyclamates got pulled off the market in the 70's in the US (but not Canada or the rest of the world) because the sugar industry saw too much of their market disappear.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet (aspartylphenylalanine-methyl-ester) breaks down to its poison constituents at 86 degrees (Aspartic Acid 40%, Phenylalanine 50%, and Methanol 10%). Remember your stomach is at 98.6 degrees! Therefore you should never use Aspartame/Nutrasweet in hot beverages or cooked foods such as Jello. How the FDA allows this remains a mystery. There is mounting evidence that the \"Burning Mouth Syndrome\" experienced by the Desert Storm troops was actually Methanol poisoning from the Diet Coke they drank lots of, after being exposed to desert temperatures.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 10% Methanol appears in the body quickly and is the same alcohol (wood alcohol also in lacquer thinner), that your mother correctly warned you could make you blind. Many skid-row alcoholics had major problems with this cheap but deadly form of alcohol.\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's 40% Aspartic Acid is an \"excitotoxin\" in the brain and excites neurons to death, i.e. it kills brain cells and causes other nerve damage.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet triggers Migraine Headaches This even happened to me!. The Usenet is filled with posts by people who have pinned their migraines down to aspartame/Nutrasweet consumption.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet's breakdown products attack the bodies tissues and create Formaldehyde which builds up in the tissues forever. Remember the smelly, eye watering fumes from the frogs you dissected in school? They were preserved with Formaldehyde! Formaldehyde is thought to cause cancer.\nThe American Bottlers Association did not want the FDA to approve Aspartame/Nutrasweet because of what the test report showed. But the FDA approved it anyway!\n\n# Airline pilots stay away from Aspartame/Nutrasweet because they are well aware of the documented dangers.\n\n# Aspartame/Nutrasweet also breaks down to diketopiperazine [DKP] which is proven to cause Brain Tumors! Brain Tumors used to be rare. Several of the rats in the original study formed brain tumors during their Aspartame/Nutrasweet exposure. The researchers surgically removed the tumors and returned the rats to the study and discounted the tumors sure if you drink like a 12 pack a dayfor yur whole life.",

    "question": "how do u get rid of lice?",
    "answer": "Go to your local pharmacy or drugstore.  You can purchase a product called \"RID\". Its a shampoo that kills headlice.  Once you've shampooed, you'll take the small comb, that comes with the shampoo to comb the hair to remove dead lice or possible eggs that may be attatched.  Very important to stip bed of sheets and pillow cases and wash in hot water as soon as possible, too.   Good luck!  (Rid is sold over the counter, btw..so don't be embarrassed.) Rid can sometimes cause damage to the blood and brain cells on the head if there are scratches or open cuts when applied.  Also, not all lice is killed by using Rid.  Try putting either vaseline or olive oil in the hair and on the head.  Wrap with saran wrap for about an hour.  Rinse out.  It kills the lice and the eggs by suffocation. soak ure hair in mayo, like shampoo, and cover it in tin foil GO TO WAL MART I THINK THE THING IS CALLED RID Don't use the stuff you buy in stores, that is a pesticide and it doesn't really work.  This is how I've dealt with headlice.  \n\nThe first thing you have to do is apply a thick coating of either Vaseline or mineral oil to the hair.  Get a plastic shower cap and put it on. Leave the stuff in the hair over the weekend.  When you wash is out, you have to make sure you get all the nits (eggs).  Do this for 3 weekends in a row, and the little critters will all be dead and gone.\n\nIt's also a good idea to vacumn all the carpets and wash the linens and any stuffed toys.  Lice only live for a short time if they aren't on a person, but there is no point taking a chance if you are going to walk around with your head all gooped up for the weekend. Sorry, but I agree w/ kytrailman.  OTC remedies DO work and they're a lot safer than some of the other posters have said.  Poor kid.  Don't subject him to DIY remedies--get it over with as quickly as you can.\n\nI did want to add one thing.  Make sure you read the directions in the box.

      "INFORMATION": "Changes in urine color, especially if it appears darker or has an unusual hue, can be indicative of potential health issues. A green or bluish tint may suggest an excess of uric acid, possibly leading to the formation of stones, which can be related to liver function or conditions like mononucleosis. Consumption of items with blue or green pigments can also influence urine color. If urine resembles apple juice or has a reddish tint, it may signal the presence of blood, potentially indicating stones or an infection. While lower back pain may be associated with kidney issues, it can also be attributed to muscle discomfort and is not necessarily linked to kidney problems. Seeking medical attention for persistent or concerning changes in urine color and accompanying symptoms is advisable for a proper diagnosis and treatment.",

    "question": "Would you categorize Bulimia Nervosa with Heroin addiction?  Why?",
    "answer": "I'm with Scorpio on this one.  Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).\n\nWhat matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.\n\nAddicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.\n\nToday, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.\n\nBest,\n\n`k. I happen to agree with your friend. I've had my share of both bulimia and other addictions, and I classify all of them as \"coping mechanisms\" and \"distraction tools\". The only obvious difference between Bulimia Nervosa and a Heroin addiction is the physical addiction related to Heroin. The psychological factors are the same, it's simply a way to cope.",

    "answer": "HPV can be spread even without a condom.  Unfortunately there is no way to protect yourself 100% from HPV, although the risk is reduced if a condom is used.  HPV can be active in the skin, even though there are no warts present.  This means that you (or your partner) can have the virus and not even know it.  It stands to reason then, that HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.  My family doctor told me to just assume that everyone who has had more than 2 sexual partners in his/her lifetime has it.\n\nUPDATE: Based on later answers, I wanted to address mutual m*sterbation.  You CAN get HPV from mutual mast.  HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye.  If you touch your partner's genitals and then touch your own with the same hand, you have most likely just put the HPV virus on your own skin.  Whether or not you will develop warts/lesions is unpredictable.  Some people have HPV but never show any lesions. Wearing a condom helps, but nothing is 100% safe.

You can also sit in a hot tub, try for the sauna action with all the steam. To make that even better, they have these tablets you put in the bottom of your shower that are full of eucalyptus or mentholatum, and that breaks it up too, just ask at your local pharmacy. Mint teas help soothe and release, and cayenne, horseradish, garlic and ginger all have things that work up into the sinuses to help stop the phlegm from running down the back of your throat, so as much as you can stomache in soup, etc works wonders. Don't smoke while you're phlegmy. And change your sheets! Any germs you have are harbored there more than anywhere! Stay out of the cold damp as much as possible, and good luck!

    "question": "What is a heart murmur?",
    "answer": "I personally was diagnosed with one a few years ago was sent to a cardiologist who said it was nothing to worry about it.  Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals.  I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.\n\nHere's some info from webmd:\n\n\nIn particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\n\nThough many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n\nWithin the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n\nA healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n\nHeart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n\n    * Chest pain\n    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n    * Breathlessness\n    * Fatigue\n    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects) it is a hole in the heart murmur is the sound that appear when there is something that disturb the flow of blood when it pass through the valves of the heart It's a sound made as blood flows over a heart valve. Normal heart sounds don't make the \"whoosh\" that a murmur does. Diseased heart valves make eddy currents and so the \"whoosh\" is audible in the doctor's stethescope. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_murmur",

      "INFORMATION": "You personally received a diagnosis of a heart murmur a few years ago, but when checked by a cardiologist, it was deemed not concerning. Many people, including healthy children and pregnant individuals, may have \"innocent\" heart murmurs that do not require treatment. Some heart murmurs, however, can indicate serious heart problems, such as valve issues or congenital defects. The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. It can be detected during routine physical examinations and, if necessary, further examination by a cardiologist. Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart. Thorough examination and appropriate tests help determine the cause of the heart murmur, and treatment may involve medication, surgery, or precautions against infections. The sound of a heart murmur is distinct from normal heart sounds and is audible through a stethoscope."

    "question": "What are some non-expensive ways to get rid of a cold?",
    "answer": "home made chicken soup Although it's a bit late now, the cheapest means of getting over a cold is a healthy diet, regular exercise, and a reduction of stress in your lifestyle. That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.\n\nHere's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.\n\nAnd, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again. Your body adapts to that viral strain. If you catch another cold right after you just get over your last one, it's a new cold and you came down with it because your immune system was already depressed from the most recent one. Chicken soup and Advil cold&Sinus...works wonderful and just het some rest The least expensive is just plain rest and taking care of yourself.\n\nIf you've been taking a lot of cold meds, they can mess with your system and cause you to not sleep well.  If it's the stuffiness that keeps you from sleeping try a vaporizer to help clear your sinuses. (A crock pot set on low makes a good vaporizer.  Just be careful where you place it.)\n\nFor stuffiness and headaches, you can make a mixture of a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a few drops of lavender oil then massage around your eyes. (Don\u2019t get real close to your eye.)  Placing a warm moist cloth over your eyes after the massage will also help. Gargle with 3% H2O2 every hour until relieved. An excellent remedy is ginger tea.Add a small tsp each of ginger pwd, fennel seeds pwd,cinnamon pwd and a pinch of clove pwd to a cup of boiled water and let it sit covered for 10 mts.Strain and drink.You can have this tea a couple of times a day.\nFor more natural remedies check the link below\nhttp://indiacuisine.blogspot.com/2006/01/natural-home-remedies-to-fight-common.html",

    "question": "HOW DO U GET RID OF ACNE?",
    "answer": "DISCLAIMER: Before using any medicines, you should consult a registered physiscian. This is only for information.\n\nAcne Treatment\n\n|Self-Care at Home|\n\n    * Wash once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil from the skin. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter in any drug store can also be helpful. Avoid scrubbing too abrasively because this can actually irritate the skin and cause acne to worsen.\n\n    * Over-the-counter acne medications can be used either at bedtime or during the day. Always follow the directions on any acne product.\n\n    * Many cover-up products are available without a prescription to improve the appearance of blemishes while they have a chance to heal. Most work well and should not worsen acne.\n\n    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.\n\n|Medical Treatment|\n\nMany treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.\n\n    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.\n\n          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.\n\n          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.\n\n    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.\n\n          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.\n\n                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.\n\n                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.\n\n          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).\n\n                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.\n\n                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK I had acne for about 12 years, and it wouldn't go away inspite of the soaps, creams, lotions and antibiotics that I had used.  I got rid of acne after doing a treatment for candida.  I took herbal antifungals, lactobacillus acidophilus, and I was following an anti-candida diet. Acne takes years to get rid of. Many people right away use OTC medicine to cure it. Destorying the live bacteria on the face is a critical action. You should get rid of acne at the first sign. Chasing pimples all over your face becomes hectic but its the only way. Some people are allergic to bacteria killing medicine such as benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin. \nTry using these medicines:\n1) Differin Topical Gel\n2) Clearsal Brand Fighter.\n3) Oxy\n4) Proactiv (RISK: Increased Acne)\nRx:\n1) Adoxa (Doxycyline Tablets)\n2) Duac Topical Gel\n\nRemember, allowing more oils and creams/lotions to your face means more blockage and heat to be stored. This causes the over size pimple. Make sure you have some sort of invigorating rubbing cream. St.Ives apricot scrub is the best.\nIf else fails, seek your Physician. An expert germ physician. At young acne years, doctors might perscribe you with bacteria killing pills. This is excellent. A topical gel working on the exterior side and an bacteria killing pill working interior.",

    "question": "why do your fingers get wrinkled when you get out of the water?",
    "answer": "The skin of your fingers absorb water/ fluid and swell also. The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them.  Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.\n\nAll cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).\n\nThe outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.\n\nSince the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  \n\nIf you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.\n\nWhen the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.\n\nIf you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.\n\nThe entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.\n\nRed blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.\n\nRopes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.\n\nWhen the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.\n\nYour skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.\n\nTake good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.\nThese contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.\n\nTaking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.\n\nYour teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  \n\nOnly one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.\n\nSome people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!  Strictly enforced.\n\nDuring winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.\n\nPeople who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months.\n\nHealthy skin makes both boys and girls look better.

      "INFORMATION": "For information purposes, the skin on your fingers is composed of numerous tiny cells, each surrounded by a membrane resembling a miniature balloon filled with salty gelatin. The outermost layer, the epidermis, consists of cells that are drying out and wearing out, continually replenished by the growth from underneath, the dermis. The epidermis can absorb water, allowing it to penetrate the cells and cause them to swell, akin to balloons filling with water. When skin swells, it increases in surface area, resembling a loose-fitting glove with wrinkles instead of a smooth, taut surface. Osmosis, the entry of water into cells, occurs during this process. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to cell bursting, known as lysis. Conversely, when the skin dries out, cells shrink, resulting in a smoother and taut appearance. Proper skin care is emphasized, including avoiding sunburn, keeping wounds clean, and moisturizing during winter. The importance of skin is highlighted as a protective barrier against external elements. Overall, good skin care contributes to a healthier and more appealing appearance for both boys and girls."

    "question": "Why do women who spend a lot of time together have their periods at the same time?",
    "answer": "A: Women (and men) secrete odorless molecules, called pheromones, in a manner as common as sweating. In fact, the sweat of many mammals contains pheromone chemicals. The molecules from one woman bounce and jiggle their way airborne and waft to another. Receptors in the nose detect the pheromones and the second woman responds by shortening or lengthening her menstrual period. Gradually, over the course of a few months, the periods of all the women living together synchronize in this way. It's called synchronious menstruation.  It's happened to me on two occasions.  Once at a camp where there were about 30 girls in a cabin, and I swear to you, every single one of us got our periods over a period of 10 days.  The second time was in college with my room mate and our suite mates. \n\nThere's still this mystery about why it happens though.",

Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.\n\nLowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.\n\nHowever...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  \n\nIf you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing! They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though. If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  \n\nI had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  \n\nEating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP. The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed. The surgery isn't as bad as you think it may be.",

    "question": "How do I cure hiccups?",
    "answer": "You are gonna get a lot of answers saying to hold your breath, but that only works sometimes and not with every person. Try holding an ice cube to your throat for about 20 to 30 seconds. Also try holding your nose while you take big gulps of water. What I have done for hiccups all my life is swallow saliva immediately after receiving the first hiccup and it goes away. I've done it forever and it works, try it next you get it. And don't over eat it sometimes causes hiccups. Hold your breath. Take a deep breath. Hold your breath under water for 10 minutes. Get a friend to help. Set a glass of water on a table with a straw in it and plug your ears and nose while drinking from the straw, I swear it works. The spoon full of sugar works too, but it's hard to swallow, you'll have to drink water anyway. Holding your breath doesn't really work. Burping does. There are two steps for a hiccup.. let's say you go hic (when you inhale) and then cup (when you exhale) Instead of exhaling the cup, burp it out. Hic, hold the air bubble in your throat and try to make it travel up, and burp it out. If you don't know how to make yourself burp (like myself), get yourself some coke or 7up or sprite, anything gassy to make you burp faster :o) eat one teaspoon of sugar, will provide instant relief! Eat a spoonful of sugar quickly. Your senses will overload with the response from the receptors that the sugar triggered off, and you won't hiccup anymore. focus on your middle name for 5-10 seconds then say it OUT LOUD. if that doesn't work, use brother/sisters middle name. 2 methods, both work, but one is a bit difficult\n1. Bite down on the middle part of a straw or pen or pencil in your mouth (the straw is not in your mouth like you are using to drink with, you are biting on the middle so the ends are outside your mouth near your cheeks).  Then drink a half of a glass of water.\n\n2.  Take a full glass of water and drink on the opposite side that you normally do (so your chin is pratically in the glass).  In order to do this you will have to bend your neck and head.  Drink about half the glass.\n\nGood luck",

    "answer": "I just had this problem myself.  I used one of those neck thermaCare pads & it helped sooo much.  If that doesn't completely take it away in a day or so I'd see a chiropractor.  A good one will take an x-ray before they try to adjust. sit on the floor or on a chair. Take your left hand and place it under the left side of your pelvis, palm down. Let your neck hang to the right. Slowly shift your weight over to your right side, lifting your the left side of your pelvis slightly. (keep your neck hanging to the right). Press down with the \"heel\" of your left hand as you shift your weight to the right. Extend through your left arm as you press the heel of your hand down into the ground/ chair so that your elbow straightens (but not over extends). Now breathe deep (NOT FORCED BREATHING!) and imagine that your lungs are in your neck. Feel for your neck expand with your inhale. On your exhale, feel for the weight of your head and gravity creating more distance between your left ear and your left shoulder. Continue to breathe in this way. If it is too intense, lean less to the right. If not feeling anything. Make sure your neck is relaxed, your elbow is straight and the heel of your left hand is reaching down. Enjoy 5-15 breaths like this. IMPORTANT: when you want to come out of this, slowly shift the weight back to center (KEEP YOUR HEAD HANGING TO THE RIGHT!). Then take your left hand out from under your pelvis. (KEEP YOUR HEAD HANGING TO THE RIGHT!). Then take your right hand on the right side of your head/face; while inhaling, withOUT using your neck muscles, use your right hand/arm to push your head up to center. DO NOT USE YOUR NECK MUSCLES TO BRING YOUIR HEAD BACK UP! Take a few breaths here. Then repeat this on the right side. Hope this helps.",

      "SUGGESTION": "An  exercise was suggested which  involves sitting on the floor or a chair and gently stretching the neck muscles to release tension and enhance flexibility. By placing the left hand under the left side of the pelvis and allowing the neck to hang to the right, individuals gradually shift their weight to the right side, applying pressure with the left hand to encourage a controlled stretch. Deep breathing is incorporated to enhance the stretch, emphasizing expansion of the neck with each inhale. The goal is to create more space between the left ear and shoulder as the head hangs to the right. After holding this position for 5-15 breaths, individuals slowly return to the center, maintaining the head's rightward position, and then proceed to repeat the stretch on the right side. The exercise concludes by using the right hand to gently guide the head back to the center without engaging the neck muscles. As with any exercise, it's essential to be mindful of individual comfort and discontinue if any pain or discomfort arises. Consultation with a healthcare professional is recommended, especially for those with pre-existing neck conditions or concerns.",

A quality chiropractor, as per the recommendation, should conduct an X-ray before performing any adjustments.

    "question": "I need to know about cnv in new borns.What is it? What caused it?",
    "answer": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is normally associated with macular degeneration. Most of the time, this occurs when new blood vessels grow through cracks in tissue layers beneath the retina called Bruch's membrane. As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed.  Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease. I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.\n\nOver half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.\n\nAbout 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities \u2014 such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss \u2014 usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n\nAbout one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n\nAt present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir \u2014 which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections \u2014 also may help babies with congenital CMV.",

    "answer": "It is pretty straightforward minor surgery but in general all surgery has risks-  there is no type of surgery that doesn't. It's one of the least risky surgeries, but you may want to keep in mind that your tonsils perform the important function of catching a lot of germs before they get further into your system, so unless you have a specific problem and need them removed, you may want to just hang on to them. There are always risks with every surgery but both my sons had them out at an early age and went home the same day and I had mine out as a child.  Any risk involved with this are very few. Ive been told that its riskier once your past childhood. My mother had hers done when she was eighteen and a day later she nearly bled to death. Her brother who was in med school saved her life.

    "question": "My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble?",
    "answer": "Give it time. With an ear infection you usually have some fluid build up behind the eardrum. Even if the fever is gone, the fluid (and the bacteria in it)can still be there. So the hearing should improve as the fluid goes away and make sure your daughter finishes the full course of the Amoxicillin, or the bacteria in the fluid can start multiplying again and she can end up even sicker than before. I learned this the hard way. If she has had alot of ear infections, i would ask your doc to send her to a specialist. That happened to me over time, and i knew that i couldn't hear well, and it turns out that i had a cyst in my ear canal, and the cyst had damaged my hearing, so they took out 2/3 bones because they weren't fixable.I am doing fine, but it should have been taken care of along time ago. Go and get checked. go see a doctor, by no means at all should you be asking for a diagnosis on Yahoo! answers. also make sure she finishes her meds...thats most important! Like anything else, nothing goes away overnight. Give it time. I've had an ear infection a few years ago and the doctor gave me amoxicillin. I had to take it for about a week to 10 days for it to fully go away.\n\nCall your doctor if you have more questions and/or concerns. I once had a ear infection in both ears and when it cleared up It felt like I had cotton in my ears and couldn't hear very well like i did before.  Being that I worked in the nursing filled I knew somehting was not right. I went back to the Doc and he gave me something to DRY it up.

No. If you were raped, you are not a virgin. Scientifically, no. I'm sorry. But since the intercourse was not voluntary, there is no harm in considering yourself a virgin. If you have a boyfriend or fiancee or something, you wouldn't be unloyal by saying you're technically not a virgin. I'm sorry about having to suffer such a horrifying experience. If it's bothering you at all, tell someone: a good friend, Mom, counselor, or seek proffesional help. :) its not necessary that you should bleed the first time you have sex.\nyou are not a virgin.\ni'm sad to know that you had been raped when you were so young. thats sad well in my eyes and the law and god you are still a virgin. It was not willingly and you didnt give your consent.  Some women go there whole life with out bleeding from having sex. But it depends on you and whoever your with.  It could happen from using a tampon so would not call yourself a virgin because you used a tampon. It is so bad that men have to prey on the innocent when there is plenty of real women out there that will give it up. NO PROBLEM.  Please just keep you head up and relize there a reason for everything in life. Of course you are a virgin.  When you lose it it is always on your terms.  When YOU choose to lose it.

You could be prone to diseases because of acidity or lack of vitamins - possibly something like scurvy.  \n\nJust a few suggestions (hoping you don't mind):\n\n- take some vitamin & mineral supplements daily if you really hate fruits & vegtables. You especially need to take in more vitamin C since you aren't getting it from fruit & vegetables.\n\nTry to at least get some of these in....\n\n- Try smoothies with frozen fruit & juice. You can also add  milk or yogurt to make it creamy. Add some honey if you have to. Mix with a hand blender. You can also buy instant ones now.\n\n- There are some pretty yummy frozen vegetables with sauce out there that are fast.   \n\n- Keep fruit around as a snack or buy canned fruit salad. You can also try dried fruit.\n\n- Keep pre-packaged mini carrots and celery with dipping sauce handy. \n\n- If you really hate the taste of vegetables...then add many herbs or strong tasting sauce to disguise the taste.\n\nSorry to sound like a mom!

Anyways, the government can't make everything that is unhealthy illegal, nor can they coerce you into a healthy lifestyle. That would be against your civil rights. However, what they can do is tax these unhealthy things (like high taxes on tobacco and alcohol in most countries, high taxes on gas in Europe, etc.). lots of things are legal, even though they are harmful ,alchohol,cigarrets,even watching television. its not up to the government to decide what\u2019s healthy for an each person. though they make life tough by taxes and laws(most Muslim countries ban alcohol as its against their religion, Singapore has high taxes on cigarretes)its up to you to decide . Besides the cigarette industry pays tax that fills the government coffers. Teens who smoke have increased in developing countries like India and China,besides in India there is a powefull tobacco cultivators  lobby.Its just like the pro gun lobby in the USA. The government is NOT the answer to everything.

Use a pH-balanced cleanser without perfumes or too many chemical additives.\n \n2. Touch your face as little as possible, and only when your hands are clean.\n \n3. Avoid squeezing pimples. Bacteria on your hands or on unsterile equipment can lead to more blemishes and possible scarring.\n \n4. Steam your face once or twice a week to help open the pores. Boil water, remove the pot from the stove, drape a towel over your head and hold your face over the pot. Then rinse your face with cold water. \n \n5. Use essential oils such as calendula, chamomile, juniper, lavendar and mint directly on your skin. Mix 10 drops of any of the oils with 2 tbsp. soy or almond oil, and smooth a few drops on dampened skin.\n \n6. Try using herbs. Saw palmetto can help balance boys' hormones, while chaste tree berry can do the same for girls. Echinacea, alfalfa, burdock root, cayenne, chaparral and yellow dock root are also helpful.\n \n7. Consider other topical mixtures. Beat an egg yolk, apply it with a cotton ball and leave it on for 15 minutes. Alternatively, mix oatmeal and honey together to form a paste and apply it to your face. Oatmeal soaks up excess oil and honey soothes the skin.\n \n8. Take acidophilus to fight bacteria.\n \n9.

    "question": "Can hypnosis therapy help with sexual inhibition or sexual dysfunction?",
    "answer": "Yes, hypnosis can help.  It really depends on the issue being addressed.  Hypnosis is not a magic wand.  Sexual dysfunction is an interesting one because many times the cause is something physical. I have told people to see their doctor first and it turns out that they are diabetic or some other health related issue.  Dysfunction is one of the leading indicators that there are other things going on that need to be checked out.  If every thing is ok and you want a little boost, hypnosis can be great.  Doing it with your partner can be wonderful. Much of hypnosis is about belief and trust.  Making the avenues of communication and trust stronger between partners will always help. \n\nIn the case of inhibition, hypnosis is not mind control.  It can't be use to make you do something that you don't want to do.  It can be used to make you more comfortable with an idea that you chose to explore.  It can be use to help you explore why you are uncomfortable with a subject and if these inhibitions are something you want to modify.  Hypnosis is a tool to get to the solutions that you want arrive at.  Again, it is not a magic wand that will take you there.  You have to do some work. Yes I suppose it might heres an article on it\nhttp://science.howstuffworks.com/hypnosis.htm Possibly. But wouldn't a person prefer to know why he has this issue? Wouldn't he prefer to be in control of changing his own life? \n\nIt's also possible that the problem originates due to a control issue. Think about it. If a person has an issue due to who is in control, why would he (or how would he be able to) sit in a chair and allow someone else to reprogram his mind?  \n\nNot everyone can be hypnotized, anyway. Certain people are simply resistant to others tampering with their brains.\n\nI'm not any kind of therapist, but I certainly don't suggest hypnotherapy. People should work out their problems while they are in control of themselves, and take responsibility for their own actions. And suppose the hypnotherapy doesn't work? Is it the hypnotist's fault? No, but some people would use that excuse.\n\nAnd besides, even if the hypnotherapy did work, you're still only putting a band-aid on the issue, because you're only concentrating on the sexual dysfunction. The underlying problem for the sexual dysfunction could be wreaking havoc in other areas of your life, without you being aware. It's best to get to the core problem and deal with it yourself or with qualified therapeutic help (no medicines!). yes",

    "question": "does being cold causes a cold?",
    "answer": "A \"cold\" (runny nose, sinus drainage, sneezing, miserable feeling) is called acute rhinitis.  It's a inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat and is caused by a virus.   \n\nThere are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause you to have acute rhinitis. You must be exposed to the virus before you can \"catch a cold.\" \n\nSneezing causes airborne particles.  Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow you to get the a cold.  Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).\n\nThe virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. \n\nHand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold. Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system. Research has shown that being \"cold\" does not make you more susceptible to colds. I put cold in quotes because cold is a relative term.  For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.\n\nAnother reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.  When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher.  These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.\n\nStill, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether you are in Chicago or LA. \n\nIt's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold).  \n\nIt could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather.  I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through.  \n\nWe have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit. When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.  If you wear the hat and gloves and coat, when you are exposed to germs in the air and on surfaces, you will be more able to fight it off before it makes you really ill.",

    "question": "Why do you sweat when under pressure?",
    "answer": "In very \"human terms\" this comes from the basic human reaction of \"fight or flight\". Whenever there is a situation that puts one \"under pressure\" whether it is giving a presentation at work or some guy is attacking you with a knife your body reacts to help defend yourself however necessary. When you get like this your heart races, you sweat to cool your body in case you have to work hard, your puples dialate so you can see everything, etc. Your body is protecting itself.\n Hope this helps. If you need claification let me know. its life\n\nsimple enough i think its cause your heart races. Straight from the source, word for word:\n\"Nervous or Scared?\nAs we mentioned, sweating responds to your emotional state. So when you are nervous, anxious or afraid, there is an increase in sympathetic nerve activity in your body as well as an increase in epinephrine secretion from your adrenal gland. These substances act on your sweat glands, particularly those on the palms of your hand and your armpits, to make sweat. Thus, you feel a \"cold\" sweat. Also, the increased sympathetic nerve activity in the skin changes it electrical resistance, which is the basis of the galvanic skin response used in lie detector tests.\n\"",

    "question": "what is inguinal herina.should it treated or not necessary.explain other type of herina?",
    "answer": "if you don't get it treated you will have very serious consequences that will eventually be fatal A hernia is a condition in which part of the intestine bulges through a weak area in muscles in the abdomen. An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called \"inguinal\" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n\nThe main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.)

      "INFORMATION": "If left untreated, a hernia can lead to severe and potentially fatal consequences. A hernia occurs when part of the intestine protrudes through a weakened area in the abdominal muscles, particularly in the groin for an inguinal hernia. Factors such as obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining can contribute to its development. Symptoms include a lump in the groin, pain, and, in severe cases, intestinal blockage. Diagnosis involves a physical exam, x-rays, and blood tests. The primary treatment is surgery, either herniorrhaphy to repair the muscle opening or hernioplasty to reinforce it with mesh or wire. In some cases, bowel resection may be necessary if the protruding intestine is twisted or trapping stool. The passage also mentions femoral hernia as another type and acknowledges various uncommon hernias."

I say nay unless a person has been in an accident and is disfigured or needs the surgery for medical reasons.  Otherwise let's just think Michael Jackson. Well, i'm undecided because some people need plastic surgery after they suffered a disease such as people suffering from breast cancer. Some people need plastic surgery to boast their confidence, so i guess it's ok cause either way they are helping themselves. well I say no because if you realize that your beautiful and accept your beauty then you don't need it.

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch.

The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.  So, if you do exactly what I say, not only will you have a chance to survive, but all your friends that may get cancer... without any responsibility, or liability, on my part , you have to enhance your imune system to fight the cancer once and for all, and improver the blood circulation in the capiliries. \nto that you have to drink as much as you can of the following;.\n\n2/3 (two thirds ) pommegranate juice, (best fresh or frozen)\n1/3 orange juice\n\na little bit of persian lime juice (mexican lime)  will do.\n\ntry it now and let me know, it should have immediate effect.",

Rectal bleeding has many causes including hemorrhoids, Crohn's Disease, fissures, peptic ulcer disease, polyps, amongst other reasons. Most rectal bleeding comes from the colon, rec-tum, or an-us. The color of the blood often depends on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The closer the bleeding site is to the an-us, the blood will be a brighter red. Bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon tend to be dark red or maroon colored. It would be best to see your doctor to determine what the exact cause may be.",

    "question": "how fast can i see results from doing sit ups?",
    "answer": "First, you should stick with crunches..they are less stressful on your back and focus more on the correct muscles. Then, if you cut out all fat from your diet and limit your caloric intake, you will see results in 3 - 4 weeks. That is, if you are doing a serious ab routinue of at least 25 minutes/day (with 1 day off a week).\nIf you have a not-so-healthy eating lifestyle, doing sit ups will not help and you will most likely not see any results unless you are doing a complete ab workout (obliques, crunches, roman chair, scissors, leg lifts, etc.) for at least 2 hours/day. \nThe best way is to cut fat (soda, junk food are the easiest) and gradually build into a harder and harder workout where you start at 3 sets of 30 sit ups for a week and add one set and 10 reps per set every week. In ten weeks, you will have a solid workout that will produce very good results. With every workout routine, you should be doing a cardio-vascular exercise (running, biking, brisk walking) to burn calories. And always consult a doctor for the proper workout schedule for your age and body type. It really depends on your diet.  If you are burning more calories during the day than you consume, you will lose weight (to a point), and eventually see abdominal definition.  Genetics also play a significant role on how hard you will have to work (look at family members).  It also depends on how good a shape you're already in, and what other exercises you're doing.  For example, if you have a huge chest, the sheer circumference difference will make your waist look smaller.",

      "INFORMATION": "For information purposes, the development of abdominal definition is influenced by various factors, with diet and calorie balance being primary determinants. Achieving a caloric deficit, where you burn more calories than you consume, is essential for weight loss and visible abdominal muscles. Genetic factors also contribute to the ease or difficulty of achieving defined abs, as family traits can influence body composition. Additionally, individual fitness levels and overall body shape play a role. For instance, a well-developed chest can impact the perception of waist size. Engaging in a combination of targeted exercises, maintaining a healthy diet, and considering genetic predispositions are key elements in sculpting and revealing abdominal definition.",
      "SUGGESTION": "To sculpt your abs effectively, prioritize crunches over sit-ups as they are gentler on the back and target the muscles more precisely. Combine this with a dietary approach focused on cutting out fat and reducing caloric intake. Significant results can be visible in 3-4 weeks, especially when complemented by a dedicated ab routine lasting at least 25 minutes a day, with one day off per week. For those with an unhealthy eating lifestyle, a comprehensive ab workout involving obliques, crunches, roman chair exercises, scissors, leg lifts, etc., for at least 2 hours a day is recommended. Gradually intensify the workout, starting with 3 sets of 30 sit-ups per week and adding one set and 10 reps per set weekly over ten weeks. Include cardiovascular exercises like running or brisk walking to burn calories, and always consult a doctor for a suitable workout schedule based on your age and body type."

Avoid Pepto Bismol, as it has something that irritates the stomach long term (my gastroenterologist told me that!).  For longer term use, use Priolosec.\n\n2.  Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.  Soda or alcohol before sleep is the WORST!\n\n3.  Limit intake of:  Alcohol, Caffience, Carbonated beverages, spicy foods, acidic foods, aspirin (or advil, motrin).   Honestly, I can't stick to this one -- but I've been pretty good keeping #1 and #2, and it's kept my heart burn at bay.  Be good keeping 1 & 2 and you can cheat on 3 -- at least, that's worked for me.\n\nGood luck! i drink milk and my heartburn goes away. i have never taken medicine for heartburn when i get it. If your heartburn is persistant and regular, I'd suggest seeing a Dr. You may suffer from acid reflux and there are many drugs on the market for it. I've found that prevacid is the ONLY one that works for me, but your Dr. may want you to try some of the least expensive ones first. On the other hand, if it is infrequent, it may just be caused by some foods that you eat. I'd try to compare times when I had it with the foods I was eating and if you can narrow it down, simply avoid those foods or be sure to take something BEFORE you eat these foods, to ward it off.

Starches and sugars make your pancreas produce insulin. when that happens your body starts to store fat.\nDiet and exercise together will produce the best weight loss. Exercise increases your metabolism, burning more calories. It builds muscle which also burns more calories.\nTry to eat small meals several times a day in stead of 3 large meals. The body will not think you are starving and store fat. Try the rice diet. A cup of rice at meal times, and one piece of fruit (any kind) w/each meal. It is about 1200 calories a day. Do it for a week, and you will see great weight loss. If you cheat, it will take longer naturally. Diet soda, tea is all okay. Then follow healthy eating habits or you will gain lbs. back. I fear what you really may be asking. But I agree, eating a balanced diet is that absolute best way to go. If you want to do somthing drastic, stop eating sugar all together. I lost 21pounds from not eating white flour and products with sugar content in the 4th ingrediant or higher. I didn't exsersize, but remember this it takes 1500 calories to gain or loose a pound and a calorie is a calorie so, eat foods that are nutrient dense vs. foods that are energy dence(high fat) you can eat more that way. \ncarbs(like in oatmeal, bread) and Protien(meats and cheese) have 4calories per gram of food and fat, has 9 calories per gram of food. That's twice as much calories in 1 gram of food, choose wisely. good luck.",

      "SUGGESTION": "It is suggested that adopting a healthy eating regimen is crucial for effective weight management. The advice recommends incorporating nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding starches and sugars that can stimulate insulin production and lead to fat storage. The synergy of a balanced diet and regular exercise is emphasized as the most effective strategy for weight loss, with exercise boosting metabolism and muscle development. The guidance also encourages consuming smaller, more frequent meals to prevent the body from interpreting it as starvation and storing fat. An alternative approach involves the \"rice diet,\" limiting daily calorie intake to approximately 1200 calories through a cup of rice and a piece of fruit per meal, potentially resulting in significant weight loss within a week. For those seeking a more drastic measure, eliminating sugar entirely is proposed, with personal success shared in avoiding white flour and high-sugar content products. The overarching message underscores the importance of mindful food choices, prioritizing nutrient density over energy density, and advocating for a balanced and sustainable approach to healthy eating habits."

    "question": "I am obsessing about a cold sore, should i worry or am i being a hypochondriac?",
    "answer": "Do not become orally intimate with someone's nether regions, (just in case you were thinking of doing that) with a cold sore. I was just at the doctor for the cold sores that I get on my lip and they informed me that yes in fact you can spread the virus that way. Don't obsess, stress can make them worse and cause them to come out more frequently. If you get them on a semi regular basis, go to a clinic or your regular doctor, they have an anti-viral pill that will help you greatly. Abreva and such only dry out the blisters, so does ear wax believe it or not. Most adults have the herpe virus in their system, but a smaller percentage have symptoms. Ice also breaks the virus down quicker once you have the blisters, and aspirin will reduce pain and take the swelling down. Don't ever break the blisters they are freakishly contagious. Other than that, relax, they're a pain in the ass, but unless you have a problem with your immune system, you'll live. Cold sores are annoying but not something to worry about.  They are an infection by the HSV-1 virus.  Genital herpes is caused by a different virus, HSV-2. Cold sores are not a welcome addition, especially when you have to go out to party, meet friends, socialize or even a simple task as grocery shopping.\n\nI worry a lot about my cold sores too. But the wise thing to do is find a remedy & take preventive measures.\nCreams are available:\n1. Zovirax\n2. Abreva (I use this)\n\nUse a medicinal lip balm, drink lot of water, eat a healthy diet & exercise well. The cold sore would go away in 2 to 7 days. Don't worry about a cold sore, just drink more water and it'll go away, providing that you don't eat lots of junk food.",

    "question": "What  are the symptoms Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?",
    "answer": "Mental retardation is the most common and serious birth defect associated with FAS.  Perhaps the most notable defects in FAS involve the face and eyes. In general, these defects are obvious and include facial bone hypoplasia (under-development), a long, underdeveloped philtrum (the groove in the middle of the upper lip), a thin upper lip, a short nose, and ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). Although the typical facial features may not be as apparent during the newborn period, they become more prominent as the infant develops. As these children grow into young adulthood, however, the facial abnormalities become more subtle and thereby contribute to the difficulty of recognizing FAS in older persons. With these physical abnormalities come sensory deficits that frequently involve vision, hearing and speech. Hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) is common in infants, and approximately one third of these infants have a conductive hearing loss and another one-third have a sensorineural hearing loss. More than 90 percent of infants with FAS have delays in receptive and expressive language development. Please see the links listed below.  Also consult your doctor and talk to your doctor more if you are suspicious.  However, finding out this information this late in life, while it may give you a reason for certain problems, you may not be able to overcome some of the problems.  At the same time, it is something to discuss with your sister.  Good luck in your search, I hope these resources help you out. slanted eyes may look similar to the eyes of a child with down syndrom.

    "question": "what is aortic valve replacement?",
    "answer": "it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow. The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThere are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n\nThere is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n\nCurrent cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices. The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed.",

This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction.

Eating less and incorporating exercises such as push-ups can help convert the excess fat into muscle over time. It's important to note that in many cases, what appears as \"man breasts\" is primarily due to fat accumulation, and weight loss through overall body fat reduction is crucial. Specific exercises, like butterflies, can be beneficial in toning the chest area, but complete resolution may not be guaranteed, as genetic factors can play a role in this condition. In summary, a holistic approach involving a healthy diet, weight loss, and targeted exercises can contribute to reducing the appearance of \"man breasts.\"",

No.Definitely not.  But if both are present Hypertension will be increasing due to diabetes complications.

    "answer": "Caffeine, smoking, and drugs are things that can very much effect sperm count.  Also wearing tight clothing.  \nDelaying ejaculation may increase the total concentration of sperm and perhaps the volume of semen. However, the percentage of normal sperm and the percentage of motile sperm decreases with infrequent ejaculation. A new study found a combination of folic acid and zinc supplements increased sperm count by 74% in men with fertility problems. Researchers found that the men with fertility problems who took 5 mg of folic acid a day and 66 mg of zinc sulfate a day for 26 weeks had a 74% increase in total normal sperm count and a minor (4%) increase in abnormal sperm count. Tell him to quit masturbating. He should also wear boxers and stop smoking. Easy have him take 50MGs of Zinc, eat a lot of protein, and wear boxers. Not only will that increase his sperm count but will also will give him more sensation. Tell him to drink more water(2 liters recommended per day).\nCaffeine gives sperm a boost when traveling in the vagina(do not increase amount of sperm).\nMulti vitamin?",

    "question": "Running a fever - 102.0, to be exact.?",
    "answer": "Watch for early signs of dehydration and drink extra fluids, especially water. Adults should drink at least 10 glasses of liquid a day to replenish lost fluids. Children between the ages of 4 and 10 should drink at least 6 to 10 glasses. You may feel better if you eat light, easily digested foods, such as soup. Many people find that taking a lukewarm [80\u00b0 (26.7\u00b0) to 90\u00b0 (32.2\u00b0)] shower or bath makes them feel better when they have a fever. Do not try to take a shower if you are dizzy or unsteady on your feet. Increase the water temperature if you start to shiver. Shivering is a sign that your body is trying to raise its temperature. Do not use rubbing alcohol, ice, or cold water to cool your body. Dress lightly when you have a fever. This will help your body cool down. Wear light pajamas or a light undershirt. Do not wear very warm clothing or use heavy bed covers. Keep room temperature at 70\u00b0 (21.1\u00b0) or lower. Take a nonprescription medication to help relieve your fever- Acetaminophen, such as Tylenol or Panadol, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin \nNaproxen, such as Aleve or Naprosyn,Ketoprofen, such as Actron or Orudis,Aspirin (also a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) Be sure to check your temperature every 2 to 4 hours to make sure home treatment is working. If fever does not subside or your temp increases, see a doctor. Just don't get too hot or cold, cuz I know when you have a fever you feel really hot and then really cold, so don't overheat yourself Taking aspirin as directed works A fever is the body's defence against germs.  When there's to many germs your body turns up the heat to speed up the metabolism to help kill them germys with a quickness.  Sit back relax and enjoy the hallucinations if your fever gets that high. bathe in luke warm water with rubbing alcohol in the water.",

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n\nIn 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n\nRecent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS",

    "question": "I've had my first period when I was 15 and have never had it since then. Is there an alternative to the pill?",
    "answer": "I used to get the Depo Provera shot, which is almost the same as the pill. I started getting it when I was 15, was on it for 2 years and then stopped. It took almost a year for me to get my period. I recently started again a few years ago and have been off of it for a little over a year and my period still isn't regular. My OB/GYN said that it can take up to 2 years for your body to rid itself of the birth control (whether it be the pill or the shot) and go back to normal. Just be patient. It'll balance out eventually. Early menopause is often an over looked cause. Birth control pills, also causes frequent missed periods.\n\nNevertheless, you should contact a Physician/Gynecologist in your area in regards to this issue so that he/she can rule out the possibility of a tumor. Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) is actually only a symptom resulting from a glandular malfunction, a chronic disease, a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, and tumors, or more importantly, a neurosis precipitated by emotional distress (unhappy love affair, divorce, and the like). However, hormonal treatment is most frequently employed when the possibility of tumor has been ruled out; while neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help, but even in this case, hormonal theraphy can be very helpful.\n\nAgain, much depends on the underlying trouble; some cases can be completly cured, for others medical help is limited. I recommend visiting eMedicine's Patient Education Center for a list of other Self-Care at Home options as well http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp .\n\nHope this answers your question,",

    "question": "why isn't it that there so many hiv aids victim get from blood transmissions?",
    "answer": "I would add that while there is no vaccine and no cure, medicine has made significant strides in treating/managing HIV/AIDS.  While it is still a very serious and often fatal disease, it is not the death sentence that it was 20 years ago.  Things like protease inhibitors and strong antibiotics for some opportunistic infections have very much changed the way the disease is managed in a given patient. Before you can donate blood you have to be at NO risk for having the disease (as well as several other diseases such as malaria). You are tested before you can give blood to make sure you do not have any blood born diseases. \n\nAs for doctors, nurses, etc... they are at risk for getting HIV anytime they treat a patient. There is a protocol if you think you have been infected where you take certain medications within 1 hour of the event, for up to 6 months. This MAY prevent the disease.\n\nThere is no cure since most people are not aware they got AIDS until a longer period of time into the illness. The virus is very tricky because it mutates all the time, thus we are unable to design a drug that will work with any mutant form of the virus. Furthermore, the virus \"hides\" inside your own white blood cells (cells that usually are designed to kill viruses).",

    "question": "Why was Eric, the Phantom of the Opera so thin, ugly and smelt of death and had yellow eyes? Some disease?",
    "answer": "hey i read this somewher, that matches the symptons here:\n\nPFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis)\nWhat is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)\n\n\nTaken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. \n\n\nThe symptoms of PFIC\n\nFIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis.\n\n These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. \n\nItching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. \n\nProblems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. \n\n\nOther common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. \n\nVitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. \n\nVitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. \n\nVitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. \n\nAlthough similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied.\n\nPatients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known.",

      "INFORMATION": "Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied."

    "question": "How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?",
    "answer": "I have not had a panic attack in four years.  Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me.  I sincerely hope this helps! you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you I would recommend Louise Hay's \"Self-Esteem Affirmations\" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches you to repeat \"I'll Handle It\", which is very helpful during a panic attack.\n\nI have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me. meditate Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.\n\nIn the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web. I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called \"Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry\" that outlines various strategies.\n\nFirst, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.\n\nSecond, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.\n\nThird, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.\n\nFourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).\n\nFifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.\n\nSixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? \n\nPeople do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!",

    "question": "Does anyone know what Addison's disease is?",
    "answer": "Addison's disease (also known as chronic adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism) is a rare endocrine disorder, first described by British physician Thomas Addison.\n\nIt is estimated that it affects about 1 to 2 in 100,000 people.\n\nIt occurs when the adrenal glands, seated above the kidneys, fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone.\n\nAddison's disease refers specifically to primary adrenal insufficiency, in which the adrenal glands themselves malfunction; secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to adequately stimulate the adrenal glands. Addison's Disease is a disease caused by partial or total failure of adrenocortical function, which is characterized by a bronzelike pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, anemia, weakness, and low blood pressure. Addison's disease is an endocrine or hormonal disorder that occurs in all age groups and afflicts men and women equally. The disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body.\n\nAddison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, in some cases, the hormone aldosterone. The disease is also called adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism. check out this link for more information - http://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw65865 It is a dysfunction of the adrenal gland that results in inadequate secretion of steroids the body needs to function (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids).  The most common cause is autoimmune (the body's own defense system attacking the adrenal gland).  Treatment requires replacement of these steroids with medication (like hydrocortisone tablets or fludrocortisone).  See the links below for more information.",

    "answer": "Your focusing on the wrong end here...the body can handle as many times as it needs to, in order to get the heart pumping to keep the body alive. The heart failing is far more a concern than the defib. The defib, you can think of it like a jump start, for a low battery. \n\nBypass surgery is a major event for the body to handle, but coding in the care of professionals in the ICU is a far better situation, neurologically speaking, than coding in the field. Quick rescusitation with a code team at bedside, means your loved one will probably continue to adequately perfuse the brain with needed oxygenated blood to prevent permanent brain damage. \n\nI wish you and your family the best of luck. Most hospitals only shock their patients a total of 3 times at 400.  This means that if there is no responce after the 3rd shock, they probably won't shock them again.\n\nFor the home defibs, and sport defibs, that is computer controlled untill the paramedics arrive on site.  in general, however, the defib machines will shock untill they recieve some confirmation of heart activity.  If there is no activity then they will increase the amount to be shocked up to the maximum and continue to shock.",

      "INFORMATION": "For information purposes, the number of times a person can undergo defibrillation depends on the situation and the presence of medical professionals. In a hospital setting, defibrillation is typically attempted up to three times at 400 joules if there's no response. If there's still no heart activity after the third attempt, further shocks may not be administered. In a home or sport defibrillator scenario, the machine is computer-controlled and shocks until there is confirmation of heart activity or until the maximum preset number of shocks is reached. However, it's essential to prioritize addressing the underlying cause of cardiac arrest, as frequent defibrillation attempts may not be as critical as addressing the heart's overall condition, which is more concerning in the long term."

Trojan, the manufacturer of widely used condoms, produces flavored and ribbed varieties. Although other companies also offer such products, adult bookstores are often the best place to find them. Locating condoms in larger sizes can be challenging, and the Trojan Condom company specifically produces ribbed options.",

    "question": "How do you stop being depressed?",
    "answer": "How long is a piece of string? Because that's what you're asking. Forget Jesus too. I mean faith has nothing to do with this. And why the heck do those trolls come here? Anyway, what it comes down to is what state your mental condition is in right now and how it impacts on your quality of life. Obviously it's not too bad at the moment because you've managed to cope with a big move, new city, and no friends around you. Doesn't sound like a person not in complete control of their life to me. Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?\n\nSo, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?\n\nOverall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that. And if you think it does, well, perhaps you need to seek a different diagnosis. A professional one perhaps? I mean Joe Public can only help so much. for me iam at my happiest when i play with video games. but mainly long walks-up to 6 miles 3-4 times a day. plus i get involve with yahoo answers and feel better too. yes i understand ur situation, i would suggest u to join Yoga classes, i bet it will help you. i personaly would suggest The Art of living organisation. check out the link u will findout more. Don't worry, be happey!! I also move to another county years ago and I know what you are talking about. just do not stay at home, go out.... force yourself to go out... go and do some volunteer job where you can find freinds or take classes... just get out Try reading this book: The only way that I have ever been able to get out of depression is when I focus on Jesus. I pray and talk to him. It seems to be the only way becuase other wise there isn't a whole lot of hope in life. You need to find something within yourself that makes you happy.  Don't search for other people or places to make you happy -- it has to come from within.  Once you find something within yourself that makes you happy, the friends and other things start to fall into place.  Search for your own hope in a higher power such as God. Find a hobby or interest that makes you feel good and do it -- this may take some trial and error, and that is okay!  Good luck and I will pray for you. I work at a counseling center, so obviously I feel counseling is a great tool, I don't know where you are located but if you live in an area that is currently short on sun light, their are alot of people whos depression is physical due to lack of light. Sleep is also a huge impact on mood, if you are not rested you will not feel one hundred percent. If this continues to be an issue, I would encourage you to seek counseling to try to find the deap root of the problem.",

While personal reports of individuals contracting tetanus without receiving a tetanus shot are relatively rare, it's important to note that the vaccine has proven to be highly effective in preventing this potentially fatal disease. The impact of vaccines, including the tetanus vaccine, has been substantial in reducing the incidence of such diseases. In the United States, reported cases of tetanus are low, likely due to widespread vaccination efforts. However, in other parts of the world with different hygiene conditions and limited access to vaccines, tetanus remains a significant health concern, causing a considerable number of deaths each year. This underscores the importance of vaccination in preventing potentially deadly infections.",

She didn't clean the wound and attempted to save her toenail by putting a bandage on it.

She experienced complications such as her spine bending in the opposite direction and having lockjaw. Treatment with antibiotics proved successful, and she eventually got better, but she still experiences lingering back pain from the ordeal. This narrative highlights the potential severity of tetanus and the importance of proper wound care to prevent such infections."

If it is a problem, I would suggest investing in a lubrication (I, personally, use Astroglide), it cuts down on the painful friction. Otherwise I wouldn't worry a bit about it.\n\nYeah, even after orgasm, if you don't produce any extra fluid don't worry :P Some women produce none, a little, and some can even ejaculate like a man (I think Howard Stern actually had a woman come in and show him how she ejaculated, ew) But it's not a problem when you don't, I don't really either, and everything down there's functional. If you are that worried, get it checked out, it's better to be safe than sorry. In my studies in human sexuality, though, I have never come across a disease in which too little \"juice\" is a predictor of any problems, or pregnancy down there. It's absolutely normal, I second what Kristy had to say. There is no standard for a certain amount being excreted during or post-orgasm. Everybody's different! Seeing a professional might be a good idea if you notice a change in color, smell, or consistency of your own secretions as it could be indicative of an infection or STD of some kind.

Look at some pics that they should have.See how they look do they look fake or real. If they don't look good go some where else.Don't just run into it and have it done. Having your breast augmented would make it impossible to breast feed if that is something you want to do in the future.

Look at pictures of gbypass procedures months after the treatment, the fat vanishes leaving massive ammounts of skin that can only be delt with by plastic surgery, again expensive and hard to get coverage for....  exercise releaves some of this problem as the skin is not retained quite as abundently...   most of all GOOD LUCK and dont give up, YOU CAN DO IT... i second syburry The good ol' tried and true healthy diet and exercise is still a good alternative.  The results take more time...but it's not as invasive as surgery.  Also, with diet and exercise, you make behavior modifications as you lose the weight, learning what works for you, and what doesn't. With the surgery, you immediately have to change your entire lifestyle.  Just some thoughts... Surgery is the last solution for obese people when everything else has failed.

    "question": "Does anyone know anything about 'perseverent eaters'? I think my six yr old son may be one..?",
    "answer": "A very large percentage of kids are extremely limited in their food tastes.  Ask your friends, and I think you'll hear lots of stories of their children, or themselves, having only eaten peanut butter sandwiches for a year, or some such.  If you are really worried about it, consult the pediatrician.\n\nPerseveration essentially means an obsessive focus on a narrow topic. Don't know a lot about it, but perseverant eating is a pattern of eating whereby a child eats only one or two foods and rejects all others (i.e. will eat only noodles and peas). Difficult to tell if it is really a \"disorder\" but it is probably a learned habit. It seems to be something that is more of a concern in England than in the USA. Don't know any connection between this an later eating problems.\n\nPeculiar eating habits can be symptoms of other problems, such as developmental problems, but I assume that your son is OK in other areas of his life.\n\nHere is some information about it:\nhttp://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/food/fma_foodrefusal.html\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/q_and_a/eatinghabitsteen.shtml",

    "question": "What's the best remedy for arthritic hands?",
    "answer": "Well, it's basically an inflammation.  Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be an enormous help.  Unfortunately, oral administration distributes the drug to the whole body, and the place where you need it can be under-treated.  Plus, ibuprofen and aspirin can cause stomach problems if you start raising the dosage.  \n\nThere is a solution- topical administration.  Ask your doctor for a prescription for ibuprofen cream.  It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n\nWhen you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n\nResults vary with patient.  I hope you find it useful. i have always wore a metal bracelette around mine and it always works for me I worked for two different Rheumatoligists in my career and found there is no ONE remedy.  Everyone reacts differently to a variety of medications which your rheumatologist needs to monitor.  Warmth is a comfort, warm climates, warm water, keeping hands and fingers as mobile as possible.

Here's soemthign that works.\nA person eats 3 meals a day fully. And lets pretend each meal is 1 pound (not necessarily.)\nSomething that may work using the one pound ratio is instead of have three 1 pound meals every day, which equal up to three pounds of food every day. Instead of eating 3 pounds every day, with 1 pound meals, try using this:\nEat 5 meals a day, BUT instead of 1 pound, .5 of a pound..So it will be easier. Instead of breakfast having cereal, biscuits, dounughts, muffin...etc try having a cereal for breakfast, then one hour later having the muffin, skipping the biscuits and doughnuts. Then after the muffin, two hours or three hours later, having lunch..\nI know this may be confusing but it might work.\nREMEMBER! If you want to lose weight, starving is NOT the answer!

    "answer": "Try the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne. The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating the breakouts. This helps prevent breakouts. \n\nThere are five steps to basic skin care not including the acne treatment gel I would have you try. \n\n1. Cleanse\n2. Exfoliate\n3. Tone/Freshen\n4. Moisturize\n5. Protect\n\nThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one. The fifth step is protect. You want to use an oil free foundation. When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air. The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts. Mary Kay is satasfaction guaranteed. So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back. \n\nAlso it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand. They are formulated to work with one another. Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people. ;) Hope this was helpful!!\n\nMeganHill@MaryKay.com if you need anything else\nwww.MaryKay.com/MeganHill to check out the line\n\nMegan I like Neutrogena which has a variety of washes to choose from--it's not overdrying. And actually, regardless of what regimen you choose--because I've actually been using the Mary Kay cleansing system for years and use Neutrogena as a back up when I run out, which is seldom--if you use it consistently and as directed, your acne should decrease significantly.  You may want/need to alter your diet as well as you may have reactions to certain foods. I used to have very bad acne. I now just use regular soap and a loufa (a good subsitute is the buf puf). The soap helps loosen everything up but the loufa sheads all the dead skin cells off. My skin looks tons better now.",

The iodine in the soil between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalacians was depleted with the last ice age.  In the early 1900s there were such outbreaks of goiter, that the area was nicknamed the \"goiter belt\" and iodine was added to our salt.  It was also used as a conditioner in bread and in the red food dye that was used in hot dogs.

You can buy a basal thermometer and track your temperature every day at the same time.  When you see a spike it means that you are ovulating.  You can also purchase ovulation predictor tests and fertility microscopes which will tell you when you are fertile.  Another thing you can do is track your vaginal mucus.  On days when it is clear and stringy, it means you are ovulating.  You can also use software to record your basal temp and mucus findings, and it will calculate when would be the optimum fertility time, along with other information.  I recommend femta at www.femta.com and\novusoft at www.ovusoft.com don't ... if you can't wait for nature you shouldn't be a parent You and your significant other Get tested for STD's, and start having unprotected sex.  I would also look into Natural Family Planning method so you can track your exact cycle and know when you are ovulating.\n\nGood luck Hopefully, you are happily married. But, anyway, most women ovulate somewhere around the 14th day, beginning counting the day your period starts. Most doctors recommend that if you are trying to conceive and don't have any other health problems that would prevent conception, then have sex from Day 10 to Day 17, especially around Day 14. Do you know when you ovulate? If not, begin paying close attention to your body around this time of the month. Some women experience a clear discharge while others experience a slight pain in their sides.

So in almost all case the person does not know that he is infected by HIV for years he might not experience symptoms for many years. Dont be stupid!! NO!

There are children and families living with this illness, and there are very ignorant people everywhere, this would make a living hell for people with hiv....

People like that is exactly why the logical answer is \"YES\" I understand some people whave gotten the disease through no fault of their own and are very honest, careing ect..., but still \"YES\" I think it should be a law, the problem is, how do you enforce it?  For the most part, those that weren't told would not find out until it is too late. ABSOLUTELY!!!! I agree with you but, since you answered my post about outside people in our country the way that you did I've just got to say that it would be wrong to violate their rights. there should be alot of changes in this country. While people are spreading AIDs in this country, their are also people flooding into our country every day and receive checks and have never paid taxes in the USA..

    "question": "Why do I keep losing weight but my waist will not go down any further?",
    "answer": "You need to target exercises on your abdominal muscles. In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.\n\nThe first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.\n\nFat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.\n\nSo if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. \n\nThe most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). \nYou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. \n\nIf you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: \n  \n1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) \n  \n1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) \n  \n1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)\n  \nYour abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. \n  \nIncrease metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!\n\nThis means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! \n\nHere's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).\n  \nWarm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes \n  \nPerform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) \n  \nperform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) \n  \nRepeat this process from 6-10 times \n  \nCool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  \n  \nMaintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?\n\nGive your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). \n\nMost people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn\u2019t matter where they come from. If there\u2019s extra it's going to body fat! \n\nI'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn\u2019t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don\u2019t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st Depends, how are you losing this weight?",

Approximately 1 percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime \u2013 more than 2 million Americans suffer from the illness in a given year. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties, than in women, who are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behavior can be so disorganized that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others. Available treatments can relieve many symptoms, but most people with schizophrenia continue to suffer some symptoms throughout their lives; it has been estimated that no more than one in five individuals recovers completely. \n\nChildren with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and other emotional disturbances are often misdiagnosed as Schizophrenia.",

I've been trying to convince her that filling her life with more waste of space guys are not the way to being less lonely, especially since the guys she's attracted to have no life. I'll tell you what I told her. Finish high school. Then take some college courses. Get a job. In between times, surround yourself with a healthy circle of friends...ones that aren't after you for money, a place to sleep, or smokes. Find other young mom's who are doing the same thing. Find a MOPS group...Mother's Of Pre-schoolers. It's a mother's group, who meet regularly (weekly) and get together with their children, sharing tips, recipes, cleaning ideas, and each others problems. Once a month, they hire a babysitter and do something together, like go to a movie, bowling or a number of other fun, wholesome activities. Getting involved with a volunteer organization will get you out of the house and helping others with bigger needs than yours. If your child is old enough (as young as 3), you can enroll them in Headstart. There are lots of activities for the parent to get involved with there, along with being with other parents who are going through some of the same things. Some people will find an grandmother-type person, who is still very active, and you help each other. She can help you with your child, being a surrogate grandma, and she can teach you what she knows. You can help her with some of the chores that are maybe a little difficult for her. The thing is to do something with your life that's meaningful to you and your child. When you get involved, you teach yourself and you teach your child, and you'll end up showing your child how to give of himself to those less fortunate. <*)))>< Geez I would say listen to starshadow and not the guy who accused you of being selfish. He obviously has no clue about life. \n  Being lonely is no fun, and having a child to take care of no matter the joy does not take the place of adult companionship..\n  I think star had a good point there, go out to where your children go, go to church, there are plenty of moms just like you and even a few dads.\n Keep looking and get out, watch out that you don't keep yourself too much at home, that is unhealthy for your sanity... Take care and Happy New Year Find a good hobby girl.  Are you creative?  Maybe try painting, reading a good novel, or scrapbooking.  Make a scrap book of your child. I was a single mom for about 4 years. I am now married, but at the time it was pretty hard. I worked, went to church and tried to hang out with other single moms with kids my daughters age. Just get involved as much as you can! There's a lot of single moms out there in your same situation, you just gotta look and talk to them. Good luck! Just dont give up... spend time with your kids...and friends.. and try doing something that makes you smile because laughter is the best medicine... and dont forget about YOU ...also keep looking for someone..i know there are guys out there who dont care if you have a kid or kids.. u can try to go to like a singles night somewhere and find a really nice guy!",

    "question": "how does 1 get rid of chronic constipation?",
    "answer": "Try getting a good amount of fiber everyday.  Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor. Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.\n\nFortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.\n\nSince dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It\u2019s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.\n\nA healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.\n\nRegular exercise will also assist in one\u2019s quest for regularity. Even if it\u2019s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.\n\nLaxatives \u2013 There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone\u2019s personal preference. If you\u2019re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. \nLemon and Honey \u2013 Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. \nOrange Juice and Olive Oil \u2013 Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. \nLicorice \u2013 Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. \nGrapes \u2013 A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. \nCastor oil and honey \u2013 Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. \nSomething else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!\nWhen it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis. If your constipation lasts for longer than a week, contact your physician. In the meantime, why not try one of the above remedies? are you a meat lover? if so, change your life style. be a vegetarian and fruitarian Eat lots of fruit and when you eat breads and cereals make sure that they are whole grain. Also drink lots of water. If that doesn't work, see your doctor you may have something blocking your bowel tract or it may be constricted.",

They give you wax to put around the spots that hurt you when your tongue rubs against the brackets and you won't feel the pain. They hurt for a bit when you first get them.They feel tight.Then, they settle down. However, they hurt each time you get them adjusted for a few days afterward. But,dont worry,you'll get used to the pain. yes yes they hurt when u first get them but then u get used 2 them really  easily. sometimes u like drool or spit or something but unless u have a pallete expander u can talk normal. if u have 1 ur \"K's\" get all screwed up. Yes THEy HuRt WhEn YoU fIrSt GeT them but just for a few days...If you eat something hard and it gets stuck in them it mite hurt...and also after youy get them tightened..but they do not make it hard to talk, only retainers do that!!! at the begining you feel really weird and it hurts a little bit but then you get used to them\nis not hard to talk at all you can talk normally I had them...they hurt for a bit when you first get them...feel tight.  then, they settle down.  However, they hurt each time you get them adjusted for a few days afterward. I just got my braces a few days ago. They felt like they were loose for the first two days, and it was really hard to eat. I got over speaking difficulties quickly, although the inside of your mouth gets kind of scratched and torn- don't fret, it heals quickly enough. After that you get calouses, so it doesn't hurt anymore. I think the pain felt depends on how old you are when you get them, what kind of treatment you are getting, and how severe your bite is. Lately, I've forgotten I'd had them on. You get used to them. Intially they are painful...also depending on your age and the condition your teeth are in. I have had my for almost 2 1/2 years and my first year was painful. Now I forget I have them...they are coming off soon and I can't wait!

Despite the initial challenges, many report adapting quickly and experiencing less discomfort as time goes on. The experiences also highlight that age, the specific treatment plan, and the severity of the dental issues can influence the level of discomfort.

    "answer": "Dandruff is thought to be caused by a form of a skin condition called eczema, which causes increased shedding of normal scalp skin cells. Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse.\nHere are some tips.\nLearn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. \nShampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. \nCut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. \nEat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. \nGet a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. But wear sunscreen on your face and body. I know for my daughter, we use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo. I hope it helps Talk to your doctor about things in your diet...

    "question": "Chinese Green Tea Benefits?",
    "answer": "There are three types of tea Black, Oolong, and Green tea. \n\nThe difference between the Green tea and the others is that green tea is not fermented, thus keeping in the powerful antioxidants lost in the fermenting process. \n\nGreen tea also contains polyphenols such as tannins (a nutrient antioxidant) catchins (EGCG which is a powerful antioxidant), and flavenoids, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin C. The antioxidants help your body fight against free radicals, which can mutate cells and make you sick. \n\nNumerous scientific discoveries have also linked green tea with remarkable disease preventative properties. Gargling with green tea has been shown to inactivate the flu virus, as has drinking a cup each day to activate the polyphenols (powerful antioxidants) that are also suspected to work well against both the cold and flu viri. \n\nAs China permits greater access to its interior to scientists, reports grow of entire villages in the green tea growing regions where cancers and sicknesses are statistically lower than the national norm. Though such studies are best classified as emergent, green tea is becoming widely viewed as one of the superfoods of the future. \n\n\nHere are just a few known health benefits of drinking green tea: \n\n\nBoosts your immune system \nLowers blood sugar \nHelps prevent cavities and tooth decay \nSlows the aging process \nHelps reduce the risk of cancer \nLowers cholesterol \nAids in weight loss by burning calories \nReduces high blood pressure \nPrevents arthritis \nReduces the risk of heart disease \nReduces the risk of stroke \nLowers the risk of blood clot \n\n\nAnti-Cancer Compound In Green Tea Identified Researchers at the University of Murcia in Spain (UMU) and the John Innes Center (JIC) in Norwich, England have shown that a compound called EGCG in green tea prevents cancer cells from growing by binding to a specific enzyme. \"We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs, \" Professor Roger Thorneley, of JIC, told Reuters. \n\n\nIt does \"Aid in weight loss by burning calories\"\n\nPopular brands include Tazo, Stash, Bigelow and Pacific Chai. \n\nYou can buy it here:\nhttp://www.green-tea-benefits.com/shopping.html",

    "question": "How can you keep someone from snoring?",
    "answer": "You can help prevent snoring by:\nLosing weight (if necessary). \nGoing to bed at the same time every night and getting plenty of sleep. \nSleeping on your side, not on your back. Try sewing a pocket in the middle of the back of your pajama top, putting a tennis ball into the pocket, and stitching it closed. This will help keep you from sleeping on your back. \nAvoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives before bed. \nQuitting smoking. \nRaising the head of your bed 4 in. (10 cm) to 6 in. (15 cm) by putting bricks under the legs of the bed (using pillows to raise your head and upper body will not work). \nPromptly treating breathing problems, such as a stuffy nose caused by a cold or allergies. \nUsing nasal strips, which widen the nostrils and improve airflow. The following are questions most often asked of doctors about snoring and snoring treatment. Easy, sleep on your belly They sell these little tape things that fit over your nose.  They really work and are not uncomfortable.\n\nwww.breatheright.com/index.asp Tickle their mustache!\n\nActually, those little breathing strips really do work. I had a BAD problem with snoring and tried everything.\n\nA mouthpiece -- no go\nNasal Strips -- not a chance\nSprays -- hah don't even try that snake oil\n\nWhat did work was something that my wife suggested and I have yet to snore since.\n\nBefore going to bed, put a piece of candy or cough drop between your cheek and gum in the back of your mouth (sugarless so not to rot your teeth)\n\nThe muscles in the face holding the candy in place will not allow you to snore. Try it when you are awake and you will see you cannot make a snoring sound.\n\nThe only downside is once or twice a month I do have it fall out and when it lands in the wrong place (on the pillow and then roll over on it having it stuck to my cheek) it can be a little messy but it does work. I used to snore in the winter because the air was so dry at night.  My husband got me a humidifier which we keep in our room every night, and I haven't snored since.  \n\nYou might also try having him sleep on his side or stomach.  You are much more likely to snore when lying on your back. lol well what i did when i was married lmao too funny every time he would snore i would jab him in the ribs then after 2 weeks of learning better he stopped lol it really worked for 7 years no snoring Yea you can keep him in cabinet, \nbut u cnt stop him from snoring! The most effective way is to get them to lose a little weight, which stops fat pressing on the throat. Stopping smoking also helps, as does sleeping on one's side.\n\nWikipedia also recommends throat exercises, singing and practicing yoga.",

    "question": "please explain about types of leukemia?",
    "answer": "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.\n\nLeukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.\n\nLeukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThese are the most common types of leukemia:\n\n1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. \n2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). \n3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. \n4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. \n5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here.

A period occurs when the body can supposedly handle it (Like, enough body fat or something) so if someone stops eating from anorexia or something and loses a lot of weight quickly and keeps it off for a long enough time, then the body won't give a period. Some factors that might interrupt a normal cycle:\nDrugs, whether prescribed or recreational\nStress\nSexually Transmitted diseases.\n\nIf it's none of these, there is a condition called \"Amenorrhea\", which could explain it. \n\nIn any case, don't post about it on the internet , GO TO A DOCTOR It can happen also if you have a very low bodyfat percentage, as is the case with some olympic gymnasts. You may be transgender. irregular? A lot of the hormones in different types of birth control methods also will cause a perfectly healthy woman not to menstruate. Being underweight or overweight can cause your period to become irregular. If you have other symptoms such as:\nexcess body hair\nbad recurring acne\nskin tags\ndarkening of skin \nhigh blood pressure\ninsulin resistance/type 2 diabetes\nmood swings\nheadaches etc...\nThese could be signs of something called polycystic ovarian syndrome...and may be why you are not able to get pregnant (I saw your other post).

Hope this helps you feel better.  signed  Bj Overview & Considerations\n\nFatigue is different from drowsiness. In general, drowsiness is feeling the need to sleep, while fatigue is a lack of energy and motivation. Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of indifference or not caring about what happens) can be symptoms of fatigue.\n\nFatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked.\n\nThe pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if you wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, you may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid. On the other hand, if you wake up with a low level of energy and have fatigue that lasts throughout the day, you may be depressed.\n========================\n\nDo you have any underlying illnesses? Is your thyroid funcioning correctly? Are you sleeping soundly? Each of these can lead to fatigue. Have your doctor do some tests for thyroid function and ask your mate if you snore, if so, have a sleep study done. If you have an illness, don't take the vitamins without your doctor knowing what you are taking. (For instance, Warafin+Vit.K= trouble.)\n\nYour work place can be making you sick too. Check the info on the webmd link below to see if that is the problem. \n\nThere are so many reasons to be tired its hard to answer your question. The best way I think is to say what is \"not\" causing the lethargy and you will be led to what is causing it.\n\nGood Luck~\n\nGood Luck.

      "SUGGESTION": "Yes u should exercise,and take B-12 for energy,it should take about 2 weeks  to feel the B-12 to start working,You may be enimic if so the B-12 should take care of this.The B-12 shots work alot better..Do you have any underlying illnesses? Is your thyroid funcioning correctly? Are you sleeping soundly? Each of these can lead to fatigue. Have your doctor do some tests for thyroid function and ask your mate if you snore, if so, have a sleep study done..If you have an illness, don't take the vitamins without your doctor knowing what you are taking. (For instance, Warafin+Vit.K= trouble.)Your work place can be making you sick too. Check the info on the webmd link below to see if that is the problem. There are so many reasons to be tired its hard to answer your question. The best way I think is to say what is \"not\" causing the lethargy and you will be led to what is causing it..You definatly need to take vitamins, you need lots of protein and iron",

Other foods high in fructose sugars can also sweeten it, but they might interact with other things in the diet and not be as effective. A diet high in protein will make it stronger, almost like burnt leather. Drinking more water will cause men to produce more semen, but not as thick. Calcium is what makes semen thick, but I don\u2019t know if you can change this by adding it to the diet. It sure does.  Drinking alot of coffee can make it bitter.

      "INFORMATION": "Yes, the taste of semen can be influenced by dietary choices. Adopting an all-vegetarian diet is suggested as a way to consistently make semen sweeter. Foods rich in fructose sugars can also contribute to a sweeter taste, but their effectiveness may vary due to potential interactions with other dietary elements. A diet high in protein may result in a stronger taste, akin to burnt leather. Increasing water intake can lead to a higher volume of semen, though it may be less thick. The thickness of semen is associated with calcium, but it is unclear whether dietary changes can significantly impact this aspect. Conversely, consuming a lot of coffee may make it bitter. Anecdotal evidence suggests that pineapple juice can contribute to a sweeter taste. Overall, controlling the taste of semen through dietary choices can be challenging, with varying effects depending on individual factors and interactions with other foods."

    "question": "should a 2 year old get 12 mg of methadone by iv.?",
    "answer": "Assuming that this child weighs around 25-30 pounds (11-14 kilograms), a typical STARTING DOSE of IV methadone would be 1.1-1.4mg given 2 to 6 times per day.\n\nIf the child has been treated with increasingly high doses of methadone (or other drugs like morphine, fentanyl, or Dilaudid) for a long period of time, it is possible that the methadone dosing could progress to very high doses, such as the 12mg you mention.  Examples where this might happen would include treatment of cancer or sickle cell disease.\n\nHowever, 12mg of IV methadone in a 2-year-old who does not regularly take very high doses of narcotic pain relievers would be totally inappropriate.  This would put the child at great risk of serious side effects (i.e. he/she may stop breathing or suffer serious cardiovascular problems). Why would a 2 year old get 12 mg of methadone by iv at all? I am assuming that this child is suffering pain of some kind.\n Though to tell you the truth I have never heard of a child getting this drug. It is just becoming popular as a pain medication in the neurology field in the past few years as it is not as toxic to your system as some drugs. As for SHOULD this child get that amount... I can't say. How often, why, to many other questions I guess. I take 90mgs daily for chronic pain and will be adjusting that slightly higher soon.

    "question": "what are the symtoms of testicular cancer?",
    "answer": "Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men between the ages of 15 and 35, but the disease also occurs in other age groups, so all men should be aware of its symptoms. While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem. However, the surgery should still be done to preserve fertility. The theory is that the increased risk of testicular cancer is due to whatever caused the undescended testicle, not just by the fact that the testicle was undescended. Common symptoms include a swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, and a dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back. Pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present. No touching your balls mister...I've got my eye on you. im pretty sure bumps on the testicles",

Testicular cancer is more prevalent in young men aged 15 to 35 but can occur in other age groups, necessitating awareness of its symptoms by all men. Although relatively rare, testicular cancer is highly curable if detected early. Men often discover it themselves through the identification of painless lumps, changes in testicle size, or testicular pain. Individuals born with an undescended testicle face an increased risk of testicular cancer, emphasizing the importance of corrective surgery to preserve fertility. The elevated cancer risk is attributed to the underlying cause of the undescended testicle, not solely its undescended state."

Nobody knows for sure why it happens in the absence of other allergies.  But heat brings blood to the surface of the skin and allows hives to develop.\n\nIf you scratch them, they will spread.  Sometimes mine itch when they're just flat red wheals, and sometimes they don't... but if I so much as touch a wheal before it swells, POOF! Not only does it swell and itch a lot worse, but it tells all its friends and neighbors, and it spreads like wildfire.\n\nI have had chronic hives for 6 months now - due to allergies.  I take a Claritin and a Singulair every day, and it still doesn't completely get rid of them.  I am undergoing allergy shots.\n\nOne other thing you can do is to get some Ivarest. You can find it at Walgreens. I've tried everything else on the market, and only Ivarest keeps the hives down for longer than an hour or so.  It's a little more expensive, but a tube will last me several weeks, instead of just a day or two like a tube of Benadryl cream.\n\nYou can also take Benadryl before a shower to help keep the hives down to a minimum.\n\nIf you don't get relief of them within about six weeks, go to the doctor and get tested for allergies.

In asthma, there is narrowing of the lower respiratory tract, and the secretions are small in quantity and sticky in nature which also reduces the lumen of the respiratory tract. So to bring that expectoration out cough is produced.  Since it is sticky in nature the person  coughs severely. Some things that can trigger coughing in asthma patients are dust, cold air, overexcertion, perfume, pollen and other enviromental factors. People who have asthma have very sensitive airways,( Also known as RAD Reactive Airway Disease) so when they are exposed to an offending allergen they can start coughing or wheezing.",

    "question": "How do you treat carpal tunnel, or how does a doctor?",
    "answer": "Your carpal bones make a u shape.  The top of this u is covered by a thick membrane called the flexor retinaculum.  This u with a covering forms a tunnel called the carpal tunnel.  A number of muscle tendons and an important nerve called the median nerve pass through this tunnel.  Compression of the median nerve results in carpal tunnel syndrome.  The fastest way to fix this is by surgery in which the surgeon cuts the flexor retinaculum, loosening the covering of the carpal tunnel. Ewww no. Listen not about any surgeries. It's not necessary. Sublingual B12 works very good for carpal tunnel. Overdose on B12 for at least 3-5 days or until the pain goes away. Take about 2500 mcg split into at least 2 different dosages in a day. You will not accumalate too much B12. Anything your nervous system doesnt need will come out in your p.\n\nThe other answers regarding the keyboard, mouse muscle usage and supports are all good also. Salon Pas patches also help. Wrist braces, changing your day to day routine, if you use a key change the style of keyboard you use, change the type of mouse (three button vs roller ball or pen style), using your muscles differently can avoid this issue but if you have pain go see your doctor&#92; and notify your employer's HR group. That is something you get operated for. Well, my mother and I both had it. It comes from typing, writting etc.. too much. If it is bad the doctor will remove nerves in you wrists that are effecting the pain and tingling. If it isn't that bad it can go away, with a wrist brace, or less usage of the wrist. It really isn't nothing to worry about. Just try to use it less. for a natural option, try \"Shark Cartilage\" capsules and \"Glucosamine\" capsules.......it has worked for my grandmother at the age of 87! in 3 days....and she is very arthritic.

    "answer": "As the previous answerer said, once you have the cold sore virus, you have it for life.  However, generally the worst thing that virus does to you is give you sores now and then.  I don't know whether you would consider it to be harmful.  I find it inconvenient, but not terrible. To sum up what most of these people are saying, cold sores are in fact a form of herpes. There are herpes simplex-2 which is a serious VD (Vanarial Disease), is totally contagious when there is an outbreak, and is NOT CURABLE.\n\nThen there is Herpes simplex-1 is is generally above the waste, usually marked by coldsores, not nearly as serious but still NOT CURABLE.\n\nThere are treatments for either simplex-1 or 2 but remember this!!!!!! YOU CAN SPREAD ONE TO ANOTHER, MEANING A PERSON CAN HAVE A COLD SORE ON THEIR MOUTH AND TRANSFER IT TO SOMEONE ELSE'S GENITALS THROUGH ORAL SEX...THUS HERPES SIMPLEX-1 (A MILD PROBLEM) CAN TURN INTO SIMPLEX-2 (A SERIOUS PROBLEM).

On the other hand, herpes simplex-1 is generally above the waist and often causes cold sores. While it is less serious, it is also not curable. The user highlights that both types can be spread, and there is a risk of transmitting herpes simplex-1 to the genital area through oral sex, potentially leading to herpes simplex-2.

    "question": "what is Fifth Disease?",
    "answer": "It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal What is \"fifth disease?\"\n\nFifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n\nParvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious",

      "INFORMATION": "For information purposes, the human body comprises three main types of muscles: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal. Smooth muscles are controlled by the autonomic nervous system and can be either generally inactive, responding to neural stimulation or hormones, or rhythmic in nature. Cardiac muscles, found in the heart, exhibit rhythmic activity influenced by neural signals and hormones. Skeletal muscles, responsible for movement, are attached to bones through tendons and can be categorized based on factors such as twitch speed, voluntary or involuntary control, and coloration. Together, these three types of muscles play crucial roles in various physiological functions, encompassing involuntary processes like digestion, the rhythmic pumping of blood in the heart, and voluntary movements required for daily activities."

    "question": "What is Rieke?",
    "answer": "It is spelled Reiki and pertains to the use of energy to heal the body.\n\n\"Reiki is a form of Japanese spiritual healing.  This complementary medicine has its foundation in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, apparently forgotten until its rediscovery in the late 19th century.  The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  \n\nA treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\"  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\"\n\nTo get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi. You can find classes at the YMCA or, sometimes, through the  adult education programs in American cities. i'm guessing you mean reiki?  healing by gentle touch and lots of love.",

For example, in the US in the early 20th century there were very large differences in life expectancy between people of different races, which have since lessened. There remain significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in the US and other developed countries, with women outliving men. These differences by sex have been reducing in recent years, with men's life expectancy improving at a faster rate than women's. Poverty and inequality has a very substantial effect on life expectancy. In the United Kingdom life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is ten years longer than the poorest areas and the gap appears to be increasing as life expectancy for the prosperous continues to increase while in more deprived communities there is little increase. (Department of Health -[Tackling health inequalities]: Status report on the Programme for Action\n\nAir pollution may also reduce life expectancy, especially for those living near busy roads, due to the exhaust fumes from cars. Occupation may also have a major effect on life expectancy. Well-educated professionals working in offices have a high life expectancy, while asbestos and coal miners do not.

Absolutely not.  Go to Web MD and look it up.  Aspirin is only good for thinning the blood and helping pain and swelling, helps to prevent clots from forming.  Has nothing to do with B/P. Asprin thins the blood which in turn does lower bloodpressure somewhat, due to thinner blood can make it past blockages easier If it is not too high it is effective, but if it is really high you will have to take a perscription Not really -- but that does not mean it is without cardiovascular benefits.\n\nIf you have hypertension, consult with your doctor.  Depending on the readings, the doctor may start with diet/exercise or may they presecribe medications.  Most cardiologists now tend to use diuretics for most patients as they tend to be safe, effective and inexpensive.  That may be supplemented with other meds such as ace ihibitors, beta blockers or calcium channel (inhibitors?).\n\nControlling your hypertension is very important and needs to be done under the active supervision of a MD.   You may also be directed to take a low dose of aspirin -- research suggests the lowers the risk of heart attacks. Taking aspirin before bedtime - but not at other times of the day - may help lower blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension. According to researchers, it seems that people who take aspirin first thing in the morning get virtually no blood pressure benefit from the drug.  Before starting to take any type of aspirin, please talk to your doctor about this.  This should not be a substitute though for regular high blood pressure medications.",

    "question": "Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?",
    "answer": "the depo shot has many side effects. the weight gain is due to certain hormones in the shot and as long as you are on the shot you will continue to gain weight. i personally do not recommend the shot due to many factors including the weight gain, spotting, and not to mention, when you are ready to have children and get off the shot, you will not be able to concieve for 12 to 18 months. my recommendation is to go of the shot. if long term birth control is what you want, you should go with the iud, it is more effective, when inserted it can last for up to 5 years, and it doesn't have the weight gaining side effect. genetics I had a friend that gained like 35 pounds and had spotting for 4 months straight, she was miserable--poor thing. That's why I never went on it--too many side effects!! After having my son, I went back down to right around my original weight.  I was then on Depo for 3 years, and in that time gained about 44 pounds.  The woman at the clinic told me that the weight would just start falling off after quitting the depo, however, it didn't.  I have been taking a prescription weight loss drug called phentermine, which works great, but isn't permanent.  The only thing my doctor can come up with is that my metabolism is changing with my age (I'm only 21).  Sometimes, you just gain weight for reasons unknown.",

    "answer": "Depends on the type of cancer and how far along the treatments are.  The best bet is to contact a local life agent and give them all the information. Don't try to hide anything because it could result in a denial of payout down the road.  A local agent can talk with their underwriter to determine if they can write the policy and at what health class. Buy term life insurance.  Its relatively cheap, like 25 buxx a month depending on age.  Go and get about 4 or 5 different policies if you think this person is going to die.  Because they pay really low.  Like 20 grand if the person dies.  But, if they die in less then 2 years,  I think its only like 2000 plus how much you paid per month for every month that you paid.  So, if you paid 25 a month for 6 months, and the person dies, they give you only 2000 plus 150.  But if you can buy 4 or 5 of these, you can find 10 grand to bury this person.  These are the only insurance companies that will sell to you because they dont have to pay back anything to you.  If you cancel with no death, they owe you nothing.",

The reason why nobody tells you about withdrawal from anti depressants is because is because these symptoms were only experianced by Lovelysmurf. Absolutely! Check the library for books about psychiatric meds and effects.  Nobody tells you about the terrible withdrawal.  It is bad and took up to 3 months of terrible nightmares, waking up screaming, night sweats so bad I would have to change nightgowns twice, and skin breakouts.  I'll never take that stuff again.  If I am depressed, I will go to the gym or call a friend. No. Certainly you need to be tappered off most all medications taken for a length of time. It is so common that doctoers do not understand the phamacology about the meds they give to patients. Some of these drugs are very dangerous and should not be taken unless clearly needed.

    "question": "iam 23 yrs old ...and my height is 5.1,want to grow tall.. but how? want some efective ways to grow tall?",
    "answer": "At 23 you have finished growing naturally.\n\nThere are no totally safe methods to make you grow.\n\nWhat is so wrong with being petite?  Taller won't make you any better than you are right now.\n\nDon't think for a second that guys will find you more attractive if you are taller.  The right guy will not care how you look, he'll only care about how you are inside.\n\n(Most movie and tv stars are petite - shorter people look better on screen).\n\nIf you want to be tall to be a fashion model, then think again.  Tall is only one of the features required.  You also need endless patience and to get used to being permanently hungry.\n\nMy advice is to relax and enjoy how you are. Your growth period is over. It depends on Heridity also. Do not take medicines for growing tall.  Since no meidicnes will make you taller. Back in the 70's and 80's, the Russians did experiments with HGH (human growth hormone) on their olympic athletes.  They grew, some of them died.  They all had Frankenstein facial looks. I once heard that swimming and basketball can help you grow taller by a little bit.\n\nBut I think you should start looking into buying some heels or stilettos.  Your height is going to be your height. at this age,metaphasis and diaphasis of your long bones are fused .it is difficult to increase your height more than that.plus it is genetically determined.if your parents are short,then u will tend to attend the same [more or less] same height.but as somebody suggested u can go for swimming or play basket ball [streching exercise]to increse ur height may b by 1/2-1 inch. after 18 its not possible\nsorry dear You're finished growing at 23 years old. Try to be happy with who you are. I used to want to be taller too, and I'm shorter than you are. I'm only 4'11\". :-) I just came to accept something I can't change. hi, maybe we are in same case.

The subsequent explanation provides a general understanding that after a certain age, the fusion of long bone components limits the potential for significant height increase.

While acknowledging anecdotal claims about certain physical activities potentially influencing height, the message humorously suggests considering heels or stilettos for personal satisfaction.

    "answer": "i'll tell you what. you go outside and run around the block. when you get back, if you can talk without sounding like you're gonna die, then you have iron lungs. if you pass out before, then you might want to give nicoderm a shot! Oh no. Please keep smoking. More lung cancer patients are good for my hospital. The answer is \"yeh you are being affected adversely\"\n\nIt may take time to build into a heart or lung condition - but it probably will do that. \n\nI assume you are an early smoker, with that, you are building a dependence that will make it very difficult to let go of the habit, even when you want to.  I've seen people already diagnosed with heart or lung disease who continued to smoke because the addiction was too strong for them to break.  \n\nNot only are you damaging cells inside your body, but you are damaging your skin.  The most wrinkled people are the ones who have smoked over the years.  You can see  how the smoke constantly building would affect the skin.  Wrinkles around the lips and in the soft tissue under the eyes are the most prevalent in smokers.  Smoking takes the vitamins right out of your body, and can cause the bones and teeth to become weaker.\n\nSo, now you see you are damaging your heart & your lungs. Your respiratory system cancels out your breathing.  Cancer is prevalent in throat, tongue, lips, your bones and teeth are unhealthy - and finally, it's gotten to your skin too. \n\nIf that doesn't make you stop - Let me remind you that you are also damaging anyone who happens to be in the room with you while you are smoking.  Second hand smoke has been proven to be as damaging as first hand.\n\nQuit smoking and people will want to be with you more often.  Not only that you will smell better, breathe better and certainly like yourself better.\n\nPlus you will save a lot of money as another side benefit.\n\nGood luck.  Hope you'll give it your best shot.  Never quit quitting. Denial is a wonderfully easy was of saying you're not affected.  It's kind of like a 'James Dean' attitude, like \"it won't happen to me.\"  Well, you can be SURE that every time you smoke, damage is being done.  It's kind of like a teenager saying \"we only had sex once.\" (and she's pregnant) If this doesn't wake you up, then how about the knowledge that there are many intelligent people out there that have done many tests that will totally disagree with what you just said.  So, you might want to creep up out of that hole you have your head in, and wake up and face the facts.  Smoking kills.  It's really 'sucking' you know! Well it is true that some people smoke for their whole lives without becoming ill from it.  But it is not possible to (not) have adverse affects, your body just cannot function at its full potential while processing that many toxins.  If you are very young or have not been smoking for very long you will feel good, but that does not mean you are not hurting yourself.",

    "question": "WHat kind of sit-up is the best and most effective?",
    "answer": "Well, situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.  And to be honest, some never get it.  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.  People dont say 8 because they dont believe it exists.  It does, and I have it.  I will assist further when you are ready.  Just make sure you rate me hehee... crunches!!! They've truly been my key to a \"six pack\"! Knees up, bring head up until you feel the \"crunch\" and back down. Obliques-one knee up, hands behind head and opposite elbow up to knee. Give it a try. It hurts so good! Reverse sit ups are more effective.",

Others contend that traditional sit-ups, when performed correctly, can contribute to core strength.

    "question": "how do i grow muscles faster ?",
    "answer": "take green tea, and my trainor said to mix up ur work out one day lift maybe 5 pd barbell in one hand and 10 in the other, if u can lift more great!then the next day switch them, so ur body is always tearing and guessing never have a routine work out, do green tea because it helps ur immune system and replenishes ur body, but try useing different amounts of weight like everyother time good luck! do you know your body type, it can realy help you not to work against your self, try to search in wikipedia ''body type'' Workout 24 hours a day. working out anything past 45 min is a waste of time because you end up destroy your own current muscles for energy, and also leads to overtraining which will also waste your muscle and prevent them from recovering thus will not build you any new muscle. So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity.\n\nalso 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above.\n\n\nnow here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which you will gain them:\n\nthe secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways:\n\n-changing the order of the exercise each work out\n- changing the speed at which you lift the weights, slow or faster\n-super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises\n- giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part\n- negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep\n- stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight you can to muscle failure (when you can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeat\n\nthat's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so you must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly.\n\nalso there is the diet component:\n\nproteins: make sure you eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that you arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat.\n\ncarbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portion\n\nfats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oils\n\nmake sure you do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow.\n\nmake sure you sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep.\n\nmake sure you eat no more than 1 hour after your work outs\n\nmake sure you have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible \n\nthrow junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. \n\nkeep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body part\n\nany more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck work them 3x 20 sets per day with weights rest every second day and drink a low fat milk and banana slurpee to help produce and heal worked muscle tissue use weights of 20 and 30 pounds................ creatin is the main matter of muscles.so buy a medicine which contents creatin in it.",

    "question": "What is Tourettes Syndrome?",
    "answer": "It is a neurobiologic disorder in the brain that causes involuntary vocal tremors and tics.  It is migratory (ie: not usually the same tics all the time, they change).  It is lifelong and there is not a cure yet. \n\nThere are medications that can lessen the impact of the tics and make them less noticeable.  It takes time and patience to find the right combination, depending upon the severity of the Tourettes.  My son has Tourettes, accompanied by OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and ADHD.  It is not uncommon to have Tourettes plus these conditions, or even others.\n\nThere has been a breakthrough at Harvard (see link below, click on Genetic Breakthrough) which is cause for hope.\n\nIf you have any questions about diagnosing Tourettes for yourself or a family  member or loved one, see a Neurologist.  I have learned that well meaning teachers, parents, pediatricians, nurses or others are not qualified to diagnose this disorder.  See a Pediatric Neurologist (if the person is under 16 or so) or a Neurologist.\n\nBest wishes to you. Cran has the definition correct. No one knows what causes Tourettes. My son has it, but it is not debilitating. Some think that it may be caused by early use of antibiotics. Recently, they have mapped the genome that may be the cause, which means a cure could be around the corner. Tourette syndrome \u2014 also called Tourette's syndrome, Tourette Spectrum (TS), Tourette's disorder, or Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, is a neurological or neurochemical disorder characterized by tics: involuntary, rapid, sudden movements or vocalizations that occur repeatedly in the same way.",

If you had any doubt better consult your doctor and under go the necessary tests. IF REALLY WORRIED THEB YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO SEE A DOCTOR. I TAKES 3 MONTHS AFTER HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX TO DETECT HIV/AIDS If you're a female, the itching and fever could be a bacterial infection.. the symptoms subside, but it will return without antibiotics and cream treatments... and nervousness in your legs, is probably just stress, like you said.. bacterial infections also can cause some discomfort in your lower abdomen... either way, like the person stated above, your safest and most sufficent bet would be to just go get tested and definately have a pap done.. good luck! I am sorry you are so nervous. The right thing to do is just see a doctor. If you have anything you will be able to find out. Until you find out don't worry. It's probably nothing anyway. The problem with HERPES NO CURE EVER! I am not a doctor but I would say that yes, you got something and should start getting the care of a competent health professional immediately.  \n\nIt sounds like Herpes- visit www.herpes.com and you can have it on the inside.  Very typcial with the itching and high fever (flu like symptoms) but it could be a host of other infections- hope it is because although treatable, there is NO cure for herpes.  People can spread it with no visable signs or symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, DO NOT sleep with anyone else until you know whats going on.  The serious thing to be concerned about is the HIV but that takes 3-6 months to detect.  I hope you are ok, hopefully this is a lesson to you and you won't ever do that again. Yes I agree, it sounds like herpes. The first symptoms for herpes is oral and/or genital lesions, fever and pain in the groin area. No lesions does not mean no STD.

    "question": "Does Mono give you Chronic Fatigue?",
    "answer": "Yes it can cause it, but not always. I was constantly tired for a long time and went to the doctor and he tested me for everything under the sun and tried to then tell me that I was mentally ill. I kept telling him that I had TWO bad bouts of Mono in my life. FINALLY he tested me for Epstein Barr virus antibodies. Epstein Barr is the same as mono, which is short for infectious mononucleosis. An antibody is something your body usually produces when it is trying to fight off something, but after the virus goes away, usually the antibodies will lie dormant. Well, I had no virus in my blood, but I had TONS of the antibodies, still running around in my bloodstream. This can and does cause Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder. Not at all... the fatigue associated with it does go on for quite a while, but when I had mono, I was completely back to normal within a year. Yes, if you don't rest while you have the mono.  If you properly took care of yourself while you were sick there is no reason why you should have chronic fatigue.  If you do actually have chronic fatigue, there aren't any cures.

It will most likely rot my teeth out, but hey, at least I don't cough. A little give and take never hurt right? As far as on a plane...try an inhaler such as Primatene Mist. It is over the counter. This might help your lungs from consticting during the flight, which in turn will help your cough. Again........just a suggestion. Good luck with your cough. (See a doctor.........I just play one on tv.....*cough*) You might have asthma and something in the room is triggering it. Ask you doctor to test you. If you have it they can usually treat it and you will feel a lot better. Good luck. You will cough more lying down than when you are sitting up.  Try and prop some pillows under you and it will help a little bit.  Also, take a good cough medicine right before you go to bed. I do as well.  Have for years.  I sleep with a cough drop in my mouth.  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME! You probably have Post Nasal Drip. Try getting a medicine that drys up the nose at night.An  antihistamine that you can use at night should help.\nMake sure you get the right one or you will be up all night.

    "question": "what are the duties of GYNAECOLOGIST?",
    "answer": "Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:\n\ntermination of pregnancy \ndilation and curettage (removal of the uterine contents, for various reasons, including miscarriage and menorrhagia; procedurally very similar to the above); \nhysterectomy (removal of the uterus); \noophorectomy (removal of the ovaries); \ntubal ligation; \nExploratory laporoscopy or laporotomy (used to diagnose and treat sources of pelvic and abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, etc.) \ncolposuspension ('tightening' of the ligaments around the vagina, a common therapy for incontinence and discomfort in older women); \nLarge Loop Excision of the Transition Zone (LLETZ), where the surface of the cervix, containing pre-cancerous cells identified on Pap smear are removed). Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.\n\nAs in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:\n\nabdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. \nvaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. \nblood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. \nhysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. \nlaparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. \nMRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.\n\n\nDiseases\nThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:\n\ncancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. \nincontinence of urine. \namenorrhoea (absent periods) \ndysmenorrhoea (painful periods) \ninfertility \nmenorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. \nprolapse \nObviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.

    "question": "What has been your best method for whitening your teeth?",
    "answer": "Well,\n\nFirst you should wash out any rott or germs in your teeth with warm salt water, then you might want to consult with your dentist because some people have ways that work for them but trust me everyones teeth are differant. You should try flossing, brushing after every meal and remember to brush your gums for a healthier flow so you can`t get any cavities or gum rott. Don`t worry if your teeth bleed when you floss you probably just haven`t flossed enough, and remember to brush for atleast 2-3 minutes. If you want cleaner healthier teeth you also might want tobrush up and down and not side to side or circles. I used Crest whitestrips for a few months before my wedding and they did the job, but they gradually became stained again.  I think you'd probably only have to do it once a year or so.  Plus, I drink a LOT of tea. it maybe kinda funny  but it works 4 me.. try using charcoal.. rub it on ur teeth... its a cheaper way you know! haha.. I used the Crest Whitestrips Premium & had really wonderful results! My dentist was pleased & noticed right away how much brighter my smile was. He said they wouldn't hurt the enamel.

    "question": "What is the average weight of a 12 year old 5 foot girl..I think my cuz is too heavy??",
    "answer": "Try using a BMI chart.  \n\nBMI is Used Differently with Children Than it is With Adults\nIn children and teens, body mass index is used to assess underweight, overweight, and risk for overweight. Children's body fatness changes over the years as they grow. Also, girls and boys differ in their body fatness as they mature. This is why BMI for children, also referred to as BMI-for-age, is gender and age specific.1, 2 BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth charts. These charts are used for children and teens 2 \u2013 20 years of age. For the 2000 CDC Growth Charts and Additional Information visit CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nEach of the CDC BMI-for-age gender specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating specific percentiles. Healthcare professionals use the following established percentile cutoff points to identify underweight and overweight in children.\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi-for-age.htm Well first off you really can't go by the charts tey use now because they are really outdated. So i wouldn't suggest using some kind of \"average weight\" to determine that. And you have to think about a lot of different factors. Ethnicity is one. Some ethnicities tend to be heavier than others. She may also have big bones (tho some people think that's a cop-out). And then there's genetics. If there are a lot of heavier people in her family then chances are she's gonna be heavier too no matter what she does. And then her metabolism also plays a factor. If her metabolism is slow then she's just gonna be heavier. But if she's only 5 feet tall then hopefully she's not TOO heavy. Because that could cause heart problems for her. But since she's twelve she's still growing so it may balance out for her.",

    "question": "Does anyone know the best way to lower blood sugar naturally?",
    "answer": "According to the \"health gurus\", the biggest single thing you can do is start putting ground cinnamon into your food--the more, the merrier. When your blood sugar is high, and you are not taking any insulin (which is I assume is what you are doing), and then you exercise, you are actually making things much worse. Excercising while your sugar is high causes your body to produce ketones. Since you don't have any insulin on board, then your body begins to starve and breakdown fat for energy. The result is ketosis which can be fatal. You need to have some insulin in you, or all the exercise in the world won't help a bit! Observe how much meat you are eating.  Around 45% of protein eaten will be converted to glucose when digested. Eat smaller meal portions. The best way is 3 meals a day within your calorie limits,as well time your meals for the same time every day eg.breakfast 8-30am\n                lunch  12-30pm \n                dinner  5-30pm\nor whatever works for you.That is the schedule that I have.Exercise with me walking my dog seems to help me.Since Christmas my sugars went from the 20's down to 8 and 10.The moral to my story is get a puppy and start walking your sugars will go down.Hope this helped you a little.Good luck Hi, I'm your man for natural health solutions. Unfortunately, I don't really know the effect on diabetes, so check with a nutritionist.\n\nThere are some things you can try. Eat a ripe papaya every morning on an empty stomach and don't eat anything for 2 hours after that. Do this for 30 days.\n\nAlternatively, research has shown that you can cure high blood pressure by eating the kernel out of the seeds of a watermelon. Eat half a teaspoon of the kernel every morning.\n\nHope this helps. I am 65 and diabetic for the past 16 years. I have a suffered a whole lot from misinformation and quick answers from people and doctors, who are not diabetic. I was in very serious trouble for 9 years, until 1998. I work in big place and finally I started getting some answers.\nThis is what I did, I am in better control:\n- I started using Gymnema sylvestre, I take around 10 tablets everyday. It must be taken with meals, since it works on food. Started with one tablet with each meal. You have learn to use it. It will take some time. I tried different brands, the one which I liked is from PURITAN PRIDE (THEY ARE ON THE INTERNET).\n- During 9 years my sugar used to be more than 350 all the time. Because I was eating very healthy (I thought so), i.e. mostly whole wheat, and other whole grains.\nFinally I stopped whole wheat, after 7 days my blood sugar dropped to around 180. I am type 2. Gymnema Sylvestre I started about 1 1/2 years after that. Now instead of whole wheat I eat white flower and boiled chicken, lentils, etc.\n- I was tired of people giving me all kind of suggestions, so I decided to do some work myself. For about couple of weeks I tested my sugar(around 40 times) before and after eating different foods. It gave me most of the facts.  By the way I found sugar from whole wheat sits in your body for 6 to 14 days. \n- I also learned acidic foods raise blood sugar weight etc.It happens because overacidity is like meat tenderizer. Tissue damage in the stomach does not allow you to digest food properly. Also agressive exercise can also damage stomach tissues, leading to excessive weight. Try avoiding just for couple of weeks see what you find? \n- Presently I am taking Glyburide, Actos, and Lentus\n(insulin replacement shots)\nMy recommendation is search google for gymnema sylvestre, and overacidity. also do not trust anybody including you, verify everything, if you can.\nGood luck. No one know how it feels like to be a diabetic except you. I hope this information could help you. To lose weight, I am on Byetta.  It helps me lose the weight & control blood sugar.

A chiropractor is not a medical doctor (M.D.) or a doctor of osteopath (D.O.), so a chiropractor CANNOT prescribe medication. I guess it depends on what your definition of a real doctor is.  Some people would only consider you a doctor if you could prescribe drugs.  However, that is the difference in philosophical understanding between chiropractors and medical doctors.  Medical doctors use an \"Outside-In\" approach with drugs or surgery to attempt to reduce symptoms, whereas chiropractors use an \"Inside-Out\" approach to restoring normal function of the body so it can heal itself.  Chiropractic is not a panacea or \"cure-all\", but regardless of what your condition or situation is, if you have poor communication between your brain and body due to misalignments of your spine, your chiropractor can certainly help.  \nIf your concern is competency, realize that most chiropractors receive their bachelors and then complete a rigorous 5 year program of classes.

    "question": "what's bird flu?",
    "answer": "Avian influenza (also known as bird flu, avian flu, influenzavirus A flu, type A flu, or genus A flu) is a flu due to a type of influenza virus that is hosted by birds, but may infect several species of mammals. It was first identified in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]\n\nThe avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3. Bird Flu \nHundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the \"bird flu.\" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.\n\nThe only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia.",

      "INFORMATION": "For information purposes, avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is caused by influenza viruses hosted by birds but capable of infecting various mammal species. Originating in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s, it has become a global concern. The H5N1-type, identified in 1997, is a potential source of a future influenza pandemic and has caused numerous human infections in Asia, resulting in significant fatalities. Avian influenza subtypes in humans include H1N1 (Spanish flu), H2N2 (Asian Flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu), H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, and H7N3. The virus, particularly strain H5N1, has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia, impacting poultry in various countries. While the disease is highly contagious among birds, transmission to humans occurs through close contact or exposure to infected bird feces, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Eradication involves culling infected flocks, and millions of poultry have been culled to contain the virus. There is concern that the virus could potentially combine with a human influenza virus, leading to a serious epidemic. Human symptoms include fever, coughing, and, in severe cases, pneumonia."

I am assuming what that psychiatrist meant was schizoaffective disorder .\nIt is worthwhile pursuing  a more specific diagnosis.

    "question": "Where is the gum?",
    "answer": "The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets (the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth. Your dentist would measure this with a probe.\n\nIf your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss  which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). \n\nI emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.\n\nHope this helps!",

Emphasizing the importance of flossing is essential, as it targets the areas between teeth where food and bacteria often accumulate. Flossing aims to thoroughly clean the surfaces where two teeth meet, requiring a technique that follows the sides of the teeth for optimal plaque removal.

    "question": "What causes elevated ammonia levels in your system?",
    "answer": "Ammonia results from the breakdown of protein in the body. Most ammonia in the body forms when protein is broken down by bacteria in the intestinal tract. The liver normally converts ammonia into urea, which is then eliminated in urine.\n\nAmmonia levels rise in the blood when the liver is unable to convert ammonia to urea. This may occur because of cirrhosis or severe hepatitis.

    "question": "i am suffering from VERGIGO. since last week,cant find the solution.need help.?",
    "answer": "I had the same problem.  See the doctor as soon as possible!  It could be an infection or the onset of an even more serious illness!\n\nWhen I was experiencing vertigo, it was unbearable.  I had to move very slowly just to be able to get through a few minutes without feeling the room spinning.... My diagnosis?  A simple ear infection. I was given antibiotics (pills) and after the meds were gone, so was the ear infection and the spinning room. My dad drinks Stugeron You really need to go see a doctor.  My Grandmother has suffered from Vertigo for years and she lives a perfectly normal life. I had vertigo awhile ago for a couple of days, and then on and off for a couple of weeks. The doctor put me on two meds. One was a strong antihistimine and the other was something to help stop the dizziness/nausa associated with vertigo. Vertigo can be caused by allergy problems, as well as other things. Basically it messes up your equalibrium etc. Try looking on line at a reputable medical site about it. try this site: http://curezone.com/dis/1.asp?C0=359\nhope it helps. agree doctor is best place to start. Treatment depends on the cause so it would be best to see a doctor to find out what the exact cause is, so the proper treatment can be started. You have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:\n\nVestibular Rehabilitation Therapy\n    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.\n\n    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:\n\nThe patient's age \nThe ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. \nThe general physical and mental health of the patient \nThe patient's physical strength \nVertigo Medication\n    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. \n\n    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.\n\n    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.\n\n    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.\n\nVertigo Surgery\n    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.\n\n    I know you're wondering is their a better way, a safer, faster or more efficient way you can permanently deal with your Vertigo. \n \n Finally, You Have A Real Answer, Equitab?\n \nHow Equitab\u2122 is Different for You\n    You only need five minutes and one simple solution for your Vertigo. Equitab\u2122 is the only 100% natural product that works to reduce the symptoms of Vertigo as well as decrease the chances of them reoccurring.\n\nIt's amazing how this simple solution was overlooked for so long before it was brought to you. \n\nHow Equitab\u2122 Was Discovered \n     You'll be shocked when you learn how and why Equitab\u2122 was first made and used. Originally it was used by a small group of test subjects who suffered the symptoms of Vertigo including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, faintness, and unsteadiness.\n\n     Once the Scientists at Selmedica Healthcare, the people who make Equitab\u2122, saw how fast these people received relief from their misery, the product was made available to the public. Since then thousands and thousands of Vertigo sufferers have turned to Equitab\u2122 for Vertigo relief. Because it worked for them you know it will work for you --guaranteed!\n\nWhat Equitab\u2122 Does For You\n     You have to understand that Equitab\u2122 is 100% natural and 100% unique.

    "question": "what causes the hiccups?",
    "answer": "A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors. Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. \n\nThe diaphragn pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs. \n\nBut when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup. Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound. Irritation of the nerves that extend from the neck to the chest can cause hiccups.",

While hiccups often resolve on their own, various home remedies exist to expedite their cessation, and in some cases, medication may be required. The term \"hiccup\" is also metaphorically used to describe minor deviations in an otherwise consistent pattern. These spasms can be triggered by diverse factors such as eating too quickly, consuming hot or spicy foods, laughing vigorously, or drinking excessively. Hiccups may also arise from anatomical pressure on the phrenic nerve or, rarely, due to tumors. Irritation to the diaphragm, a muscle aiding in breathing, is the underlying cause of hiccups.

    "question": "what is a NO CARB DIET?",
    "answer": "Carbs are carbohydrates which is sugar or foods that turn into sugar in your system. Pasta, potatoes,may vegetables, cookeis, candy, ice cream, bread.. A popular no carb diet is the Atkins, it works great to lose the initial pounds but is near impossible to stick with. uh.........I don't think you can survive without carbs. no sugar Political Joke...\n\nNo\nChaney\nAshcroft\nRumsfelt\nBush mmmm...water and lettuce!! A diet without carbohydrates.  A no carb diet is probably a bad idea, but low-carb diets have been very popular in recent years.\n\nAs with any diet, it works best if you eat sensible portions and exercise. Low carb diets are based on the premise that a diet very low in carbohydrate leads to a reduction in the body's insulin production, resulting in fat and protein (muscle) stores being used as its main energy source Foolishness. Carbs are not necesarily bad for you unless you get the type that is. You must look up waht not eat or ask your doctor, or a nutritionist. Low carb diet\u201d (also called \u201creduced carbohydrate\u201d or \u201ccontrolled carbohydrate\u201d) is a broad term, encompassing many popular diet books (examples: Atkins, South Beach, Zone, Protein Power, Sugar Busters, Carbohydrate Addicts Diet) as well as eating plans that don\u2019t follow a rigid format, but advise limiting the consumption of foods with a lot of carbohydrate. Some diets limit the amount of overall carbohydrate, while others focus on certain types of foods, generally ones high in starch and sugars, such as the \u201cNo White Foods\u201d approach. Still others focus on how glycemic the diet is.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to equate \u201clow carb\u201d with the very low carb phase of some popular diets. These phases are usually meant to be quite short, with more carbohydrate phased in after that. Other diets begin at a higher level of carbohydrate, but still less than the USDA Food Pyramid suggests. Any diet whose primary focus is the reduction of carbohydrate in any way is what is meant by \u201clow carb\u201d on this site. In terms of percentages, since the usual \u201cmainstream\u201d recommendation is a diet with 50-65% calories from carbohydrate, I consider a diet with 40% or less energy from carbs a \u201clow-carb diet\u201d, though most of them don\u2019t measure it in this way. The natives in Alaska, I think their called the Inuit, live off of only meat which has no carbs. Though this diet doesn't seem to fair well with most others accustomed to a eurasian diet. And you can get scurvy if you cook the meat, strangley enough. The meat tends to lose their vitamins when cooked.",

The advice also underscores the importance of drinking ample water, not only for hydration but also for aiding in flushing out fats broken down by the body. The concluding words express encouragement for sticking to the diet and wishing the individual good luck in their efforts.",
      "EXPERIENCE": "For effective dieting, one person recommends consuming ample water and incorporating plenty of vegetables into the diet. They express a preference for snacks like baby carrots and celery sticks, emphasizing the importance of reading labels to stay within specified limits for fat and calories. Additionally, the individual mentions nibbling on a modest portion of saltless saltine crackers but highlights the significance of regular workouts to burn off consumed calories.

    "question": "someone smokes marijuana for 30 years and suddenly stops.  What kind of withdrawal symptoms would be displayed",
    "answer": "You did not say whether this person was a daily user or a recreational drug user. Are they using other drugs also? Do they use marijuana concurrently with alcoholic beverages? Marijuana in itself is not physically addicting. Behavioral mechanisms and social elements of lifestyle contribute to the perception of \"withdrawal.\" What prompted the individual to stop? Was it a life changing circumstance, social or economic pressure, or other compelling factors? Yes there will be anxiety from not having the familiar \"high\" and professional help in the way of counseling and medication may be needed. Seek advice from a trained professional. (MD, Therapist, Counselor) They hate the couch, swear off cheetoes and twinkies, have no sense of humor, they find stuff lost for years, and lose all thirst!\n\nok, so uhhhh seriously, as a general rule the withdrawal symptoms of any drug will usually be the opposite effects of the drug itself. Although pot will undoubtedly have some withdrawal symptoms physiologically, they are likely to be subtle...perhaps a reduction of appetite or some mild headaches. The more obvious is likely to be psychological...most notably irritablility, social dysfunctions, personality changes in general, etc...\n\nIf they have made a concious effort to stop, then good for them, its never an easy thing to do and good support of sober people is a must. One must rebuild friendships away from drug users to be successful. It becomes a sad and difficult process that will serve them well in the long run. Emotional withdrawal is the only apparent thing. They would miss the feeling of being high. They would probably experience some level of remorse at some point over all the time lost smoking MJ, since they could have been doing other things.",

    "question": "Is there any medicine to cure cancer?",
    "answer": "Yes, there are many cures however these cures are purchased by the gov. and FDA and like groups and destroyed because there are currently health-related businesses that are making billions of dollars a year on sick people. These cures are natural, mainly herbal and anyone could grow them. That would send FDA's profits down the tube. The FDA and hospitals are businesses, so they'll do whatever it takes to keep these cures buried. Here is a clue, though. Many herbs bottles say that their product hasn't been tested by the FDA and must deny any ability to cure. You can find lots of research nowdays. Kevin Trudeau has written alot on this subject. If you know someone with cancer, it's worth looking into and reading about eastern medicine. So, is there a medicine to cure cancer? Medicine meaning drugs - no. Drugs are poison; creations in a lab. Medicine like herbs - yes! Unfortunately nothing to cure cancer no,but there are better screening and diagnostic tests that can be done earlier and more effectively to extend the life of those afflicted.\n\nHopefully soon there will be a cure. Of course. Exspecially if you believe there is. no there is no medicine cure for cancer. surgery may help to remove certain cancer mass. chemotherapy is also a palliative treatment. Medicine is getting close to a breakthrough method for actually attacking several types of cancers without side effects. Read the yahoo news and type \"cancer\" and you will see the latest approaches. So far, the issue with cancer is that there a gazillions of types of cancer, so it's not easy to find a cure for all of them. Wishing you well...",

SSRI antidepressants are known to cause a delayed oragasm... the FDA has not officially allowed this drug to be used for this reason.. so your doctor might not cut you an Rx for it.. some will.. the ones with self respect wont... The precocious ejaculation is more a mental behaviour than a disease.\nBe calm and relaxed first of any thing!\nSincerely I don\u2019t know if there is some specific recognized drug and you could ask about it to your doctor.  \nSomebody, by himself, is using to think other events during the sexual act just to get distracted\u2026 or to stop a bit before the climax\u2026 or to hit the penis because the ache blocks temporarily the lust\u2026 etc. \nAt last, I advise you to begin the \u201cfull sexual act\u201d (penetration) only after many others stuffs you can carry on with your partner, with the purpose to satisfy better her, who generally needs longer times for reaching the orgasm. In the case, you are able to act again after short time then, the most is done! As I told someone else in answer to their question... try using the \"edging\" technique.  When your pleasuring yourself work yourself up until you feel like your going to cum.  Then stop.  Repeat this as many times in one session as you can.  Enough practice and you should notice your staying power improving.  You can also have your girl friend or significant other help you with this.  They can \"lend a hand\" so to speak.

    "question": "What should I do about chapped lips?",
    "answer": "The first step in preventing chapped lips is to stop licking. Constant wetting and drying sucks the moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which prompts more licking, creating a vicious cycle. Dehydrated lips are also more susceptible to dry, windy conditions. \n-- A moisturizing lip balm, especially those containing dimethicone, will help retain natural moisture and protect dry, chapped lips. \n-- Drinking lots of water will help prevent dehydration, which may contribute to chapped lips and dry skin. \n-- Smoothing a generous coating of lip balm on lips before bed will help to moisturize lips while you sleep. \n-- The sun's UV rays are responsible for 90 percent of visible damage we commonly attribute to aging. A lip balm that contains a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 will help prevent sunburn during outdoor activities, and may reduce the risks of skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects of the sun. \n-- Regular lipstick products, especially some long-wearing varieties, may feel drying. A base coat of lip balm will add needed moisture during winter months. \n-- If lips become chapped, avoid wearing lipsticks while lips are recovering as drying products in color pigments may irritate chapped lips. Also keep acidic foods from touching delicate lips until they've healed. \n-- Lip exfoliators such as Softlips Nightly Care(TM) buff away dry, dead skin cells and stimulate growth of new, vibrant cells. The interactive Beta Hydroxy formula of Softlips Nightly Care(TM) conditions lips that may be sensitive to strong Alpha Hydroxy chemical peels, and the overnight system helps reduce concern about sun damage to freshly exfoliated skin. \n\nFor more information and tips, see the website below! MEDICATED CHAPSTICK, I PERFER BEES WAX OR BLISTIC, U KNOW ANYTHING LIKE THAT. My 4 year old's daughter's lips are severly chapped, and we can't stop her from licking her lips, etc.  We found what helped was a combination of:\n\nLots of Vaseline at nighttime (big time coat it)\nHeavy Carmex chapstick/goo stuff during the day.\n\nIt has really helped her.\n\nGood luck! ChapStick or other lip balms such as Carmex. In the future, apply these to your lips regularly throughout the day and quit when you feel they aren't getting chapped anymore. the truth about chapped lips and dry skin is that your body is not getting enough water.  Although lotions and lip balms cvoat and hold in moisture, nothing can truely put moisture into your body except water.  Your best bet is to drink at least 8 - 8oz glasses of water per day along with using chap stick for your lips and lotion for your skin. chapstick and try drinking water to keep them from getting chaped again it works for me You should use medicated chapstick, apply it genourously and probably every hour. Have a tube of lip balm where ever you are.Car,purse,bedroom.Apply it every few hours.Winter does a number on lips.Even vaseline will protect your lips from the harsh dry weather.Or wear moisturing lipstick.Good luck! burt's bees lip balm found @ drugstore",

    "question": "can kissing cause HIV  infection ?",
    "answer": "Not dry kissing but wet kissing. NO!  HIV is not transferable through saliva.  HIV is only transferable through blood and sexual intercourse. no Nope, only exchange in blood and/or semen. Not unless your mate has it. But it starts out with AIDS wich is bad but not so bad and then turns into HIV which is terrible. Theoretically yes. The probability of it happening through this method are very low, but still plausible nonetheless. I tend to believe the Centers for Disease Control. It is this and other public misconceptions of the HIV virus that seems to be allowing it to propagate rapidly throughout the world. We need to educate ourselves on this epidemic before it is too late. Only if you have open sores in or around your mouth will you be subject to the virus, but no you can't contract the HIV virus from saliva. absolutely not I know several people who are HIV+, and the odds in catching HIV from kissing are far the than winning the lottery--when you actually need the money. the most likely way for you to catch it by kissing is if both people have cuts in their mouths. even still, with combination therapy (that is, if they are on [or have taken] meds), this occurence most likely WILL NOT HAPPEN.  however, if it goes past making out, then you gotta be careful. One more thing, while kissing an HIV+ person may be safe, you may want to watch out for anyone who may have MONO or HERPES. Causes of HIV/AIDS \nCause of HIV/AIDS: AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. People diagnosed with AIDS may get life-threatening diseases called opportunistic infections, which are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick. 1 \n\nCause statistics for HIV/AIDS: The following are statistics from various sources about the causes of HIV/AIDS: \n\n57.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through sex with other men in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n24% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n9.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n38% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \n59% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau) \nCause details for HIV/AIDS: HIV disease is characterized by a gradual deterioration of immune function. Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called \"T-helper cells,\" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. \n\nA healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. \n\nMost scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS.\n\nCHECK OUT THE WHOLE INFORMATION AT THE SOURCED WEBSITE!",

    "answer": "eat 4-6 small meals every day instead of 2 or 3 large ones - pay attention to portion sizes when you do this... eat a variety of proteins, carbs, fruits, and veggies, and drink tons of water! Dehydrated fat cells stick together causing them to stick to you! When you drink water, it hydrates the fat cells and makes them separate so they can be flushed out... If you do nothing else in the area of exercise - walk for 30 minutes a day. Even if you have to separate it into time blocks, every step you take is another step you hadn't taken before. \n\n*If you have a salty-tooth but don't want to eat anything really heavy - try popcorn with limited salt/butter.\n\n*For a sweet-tooth that can't be appeased by fruits, eat cotton candy... even though it's pure sugar, you have to eat a TON of it for the calories to really add up :) Google your ideal caloric intake based on your age, height, and weight. There are 3500 calories in a pound. And let's say for example you need 2000 calories per day. If you cut back to 1500, then you would lose 1lb per week. If you exercise, and burn an additional 300 calories per day, then you would lose almost 2lbs per week. Forget all the fad diets. This works! I promise! This may sound trite, but look at the Food Guide Pyramid.  Eat from all of the food groups listed, including the recommended daily allowance of each.  I think serving sizes is the key!  How many slices of  pizza constitutes a serving size?  Do we really only eat one cup of cereal in the morning?

It is a great appetite suppressent, but it is not without side effects. They cause mood swings, irritability and a very dry mouth (bad taste too!), Oh! the headaches too! I'm not sure what it feels like to come off Meth (referring to Vixxenkitty's answer), but I don't experience anything like coming off a drug. After I had my baby, my metabolism was shot, so I needed a little help (willpower boost) to get me back on the right track to eating right. I am exercising 6 days a week as well. I feel that, without exercise, no weight loss is effective or will last long. I have only been taking the pills for about a month, and I plan to stop taking them in a couple of weeks.

ASAP!\n\nIf you are asking about prognosis, there are lots of variables in play as to prognosis of the person you know (I am assuming it is you for the remainder of the answer). Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, specific type of cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to (if any), treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc. And it is important to remember that lots of people survive breast cancer. \n\nI would start by seeing a medical oncologist and/or oncologic surgeon -- ideally one who tends to focus on breast cancers. They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks. Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go. Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes. Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information. If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask! Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.\n\nOdds are that they will need to conduct additional tests (to determine the specific type and to see if it has spread).  That is normal. Any amount of cancer is dangerous and needs to be checked out ASAP before it spreads and grows. A doctor can tell you if removing it will stop the spread...but you'll most like have to go back to get check ups to measure if any is left in your body.\n\nDelaying your visit to the doctors is not recommended. Don't wait, see a Doctor, don't take the advice you get on here except to see a doctor.  Most doctors are too busy doctoring to be on this site. I agree! My grandmother's breast tumor was the size of a quarter also, and she had to have it removed and undergo 6 weeks of chemo...Luckily she is still alive and well, but see a doctor now! This depends on the histology of the mass; whether it is poorly differentiated or not, the staging is perhaps the single most important factor, by the time the tumour is this large, and if indeed it is infiltrating ductal carcinoma NOS, then I'd be particularly concerned about metastasis to the lungs and liver, be it lymphangitic spread to the lungs, or hematogenic spread to the contralateral breast.  \n\nIn summary, it's a difficult question to answer without knowing specific details about the tumour in question.

    "question": "does drinking a lot of water kill your appetite? how often should i drink it?",
    "answer": "No. It doesn't.\n\nThough no single formula fits all people, several guidelines are available to help you estimate how much to drink each day. Delve into your daily fluid needs to learn how your body uses water and what factors may increase \u2014 or decrease \u2014 your water requirements.\n\nLack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry on normal functions. Even mild dehydration \u2014 as little as a 1 percent to 2 percent loss of your body weight \u2014 can sap your energy and make you tired. Dehydration poses a particular health risk for the very young and the very old. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include:\n\nExcessive thirst \nFatigue \nHeadache \nDry mouth \nLittle or no urination \nMuscle weakness \nDizziness \nLightheadedness \n\nEvery day you lose water through sweating \u2014 noticeable and unnoticeable \u2014 exhaling, urinating and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you need to replace this water by consuming beverages and foods that contain water. So how much water, or more precisely fluid, do you need?\n\nThis isn't an easy question to answer. A healthy adult's daily fluid intake can vary widely. Most people drink fluid to quench thirst, to supply perceived water needs and \"out of habit.\" At least three approaches estimate total fluid (water) needs for healthy, sedentary adults living in a temperate climate.\n\nReplacement approach. The average urine output for adults is 1.5 liters a day. You lose close to an additional liter of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. Food usually accounts for 20 percent of your fluid intake, so you if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day (a little more than 8 cups), along with your normal diet, you can replace the lost fluids. \nEight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Another approach to water intake is the \"8 x 8 rule\" \u2014 drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day (about 1.9 liters). The rule could also be stated, \"drink eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day,\" as all fluids count toward the daily total. Though this approach isn't supported by scientific evidence, many people use this basic rule as a guideline for how much water and other fluids to drink. \nDietary recommendations. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men consume 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages a day. These guidelines are based on national food surveys that assessed people's average fluid intakes. I have to disagree with most of the people I guess. Drinking cold water does suppress appetite because it sits in your stomach longer and makes you feel fuller. Your stomach has to heat it up before your body can process it, so it can trick your stomach into curbing the urge for munchies. No, it doesn't kill your appetite. Depending on the climate in which you live you should drink 8 or more cups of water a day. you shud drink about half a gallon of water a day",

      "INFORMATION": "For information purposes, the lack of water in the body can lead to dehydration, even with a mild loss of 1 percent to 2 percent of body weight, causing fatigue and diminished energy. Dehydration is especially risky for the very young and the elderly. Symptoms include excessive thirst, headache, dry mouth, little or no urination, muscle weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness. Daily water loss occurs through various means like sweating, exhaling, urination, and bowel movements. To maintain proper bodily function, it's essential to replace lost fluids by consuming water-containing beverages and foods. While there's no universal recommendation for daily fluid intake, common approaches include the replacement approach, which suggests consuming at least 8 cups (2 liters) of water a day, and dietary recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, suggesting about 13 cups for men and 9 cups for women. Despite the lack of scientific consensus, many people use the \"8x8 rule\" as a guideline for fluid intake. Additionally, drinking cold water may help suppress appetite by making the stomach feel fuller, but this effect is temporary and doesn't eliminate hunger.",
      "SUGGESTION": "It is suggested that determining the ideal daily fluid intake can vary among individuals, and while no single formula fits everyone, there are guidelines to estimate your needs. The \"8 x 8 rule\" suggests consuming eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, equivalent to about 1.9 liters. This rule emphasizes that all fluids contribute to the daily total. Climate can also influence water requirements, with a general recommendation of drinking 8 or more cups of water daily. Another perspective suggests consuming about half a gallon, emphasizing the importance of understanding your body's water usage and recognizing factors that can influence your hydration needs."

    "question": "why do i have headaches everyday?",
    "answer": "If your Doctor said that it is not migrains then it is probably tension headaches.  This is cause by contraction of some of the back muscles related to stress such as Trapezius, semispinalis capitits, splenious capitis etc.. Basically this tension that most probably is triggered by some sort of stress puts pressure on a spinal nerve coming out of the spinal cord that inhibits the optimum potential of your body to function properly.. Chiropractic uses a non invasive procedure to remove that nerve interference and permit the body to function in harmony without obstruction.. Chiropractic is proven and documented by peer reviewed journals to be effective with patients that have headaches.. What you don't want to do is rely on medication because your body will adapt to the chemicals and you'll always have to take them to feel normal.. Don't forget about the side effects that all medications have especially to the liver!!!! Get your spine checked and the headaches will go away.. Because alll girls are always in pain.   I learned this when i began dating.  Girls always are going through some sort of pain. I have headaches every day too. I have sinus, allergies,lots of stress,and bad eyes. These are all different causes of headaches. Even high blood pressure can cause headaches, could be many different reasons.  Have a doctor check it out. Is there enough protein in your diet? I know that when you're lacking in that, it can cause headaches. Stress or caffeine addiction.  Where on your head does it hurt? Well I noticed you wear glasses in your little avatar. I wear glasses. I notice that I get headaches when my precription needs to be changed because of eye strain OR  you recently got a new one and your eyes are adjusting. if they're just headaches, you may be not getting enough sleep or working too hard, or too much stress. if they are migranes, it's physical. you should take pills for those.",

Physical reasons might be that the part of your body may be too tight to allow for good circulation.  In this case, you must stretch (eg. yoga or pilates) and exercise to loosen up that area.  Doing heat pack will also help to aid the blood flow temporarily.  One important thing to remember though is that the source of tightness might be completely unexpected.  If you have cold hands, it may be more helpful to stretch your calves or your shoulders depending on your body structure rather than the hand itself.  You must remember to treat your body as a whole.  Chemical reasons could come from your diet or the air you breathe or any other intake (eg. tobacco or drugs).  This could alter the chemical make up of your bloodstream.  In this case, what you would have to do is to remove the chemical that is causing the problem.

      "INFORMATION": "For information purposes, all hair on the human body generally grows at about the same speed. However, certain types of hair, such as eyelashes, are pre-programmed to grow to specific lengths. For example, eyelash hair takes about two to three months to grow to a certain length before falling out, and a new one begins to grow in its place. This cycle repeats throughout a person's life. While eyelashes may appear to grow faster, they don't become exceptionally long because they naturally fall out and are replaced in a continuous cycle. This information is generally applicable to individuals beyond the baby stage.",
      "EXPERIENCE": "In one case, a friend experienced rapid eyelash growth after accidentally burning his eyelashes. By the fifth day, his eyelashes had returned to normal length. In another instance, a pediatrician advised trimming a baby sister's eyelashes when she was a few weeks old, suggesting that such practices might influence the perceived length of eyelashes. However, it's important to note that natural growth cycles and genetics play significant roles in determining the length of eyelashes."

Otherwise rest, fluids, and soup works :) TREATMENT\nThere is no cure for the common cold, but you can get relief from your cold symptoms by\n\n    * Resting in bed\n    * Drinking plenty of fluids\n    * Gargling with warm salt water or using throat sprays or lozenges for a scratchy or sore throat\n    * Using petroleum jelly for a raw nose\n    * Taking aspirin or acetaminophen, Tylenol, for example, for headache or fever \n\nA word of caution: Several studies have linked aspirin use to the development of Reye's syndrome in children recovering from flu or chickenpox. Reye's syndrome is a rare but serious illness that usually occurs in children between the ages of 3 and 12 years. It can affect all organs of the body but most often the brain and liver. While most children who survive an episode of Reye's syndrome do not suffer any lasting consequences, the illness can lead to permanent brain damage or death. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children and teenagers not be given aspirin or medicine containing aspirin when they have any viral illness such as the common cold. Excercise is the best thing to prevent a cold. I have'nt had a cold in over 10 years because I excercise and make sure to get loads of vitamin C to help boost my studly immune system. My immune system is grade A stud. rest and soup and some over the counder medicene will do the trick i just got over it and thats what i did for it. drink lots of water.. it does wonders! and try to take vitamin C everyday.. hope it works for you.. \u00dc There is no cure for the common cold.

    "answer": "I say you get off the internet and get checked out you may have something more serious than herpes with a fever and diarhea. Drs. have to be confidential about your problem so go out of town if your scared someone will see you at the clinic. It can take up to two to three weeks for herpes to erupt with physical lesions after being infected, so it is possibly too soon to have an outbreak.  However everyone responds differently to herpes in the initial infection phase, and some people never break out (about 25%), and many only have very mild symptoms, yet they are contagious (called asymptomatic viral shedding).  So even if you don't see an outbreak, that doesn't mean you don't have herpes.  If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.  If you don't break out, you need to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time you were exposed to get a blood test done for herpes antibodies.  It will tkae that long for your body to produce a detectable level with high certainty.  Be sure to get an antibody test for both herpes 1 and 2, that tests for IgM antibodies.  The standard in this case is a test called the the HerpeSelect antibody test.",

    "question": "why do we fart?",
    "answer": "QUOTE: \"Well, for starters, the gas that makes up a fart comes from two sources: more originates from the breakdown of food by the digestive system, and some is from swallowed air. In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\" What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt. Intestinal gas comes from several sources: air we swallow, gas that seeps into our intestines from our blood, gas produced by chemical reactions in our guts, and gas produced by bacteria living in our guts. Burps are not farts that come out your mouth. They have to do with your stomach. The feces is decaying, and thus gives off gas, when enough gas is built up, it come out.",

    "answer": "It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves. I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS. If so, counseling is for you. If not, you could certainly consider going by yourself to work on strategies to deal with the stress and anxiety this causes you. I think counseling would be a great place to start, and also perhaps some family couseling.  Look through the phone book for family counselors.\n\nGood luck to you. My first response to your question is YES, you should find a family counselor who will work with your family both as a unit and individually- \n\n\"ways to feel better about myself, not feel like a failure at life, and feel happy and enjoy each day\"\n\nFrom that statement I would most definately reccoment you seek someone whose philosophys lie in cognitive-behavioral therapy- I think it could really benefit your family I feel we all need counselors, but they r cvery expensive, and time consuming.You can always try an alternative like going to a really truly trusted friend.Or u can try to counsel ur self, ppl do tat all the time. It's not reccomended, but somtimes it's the only way. arguing and fighting within a family is normal but doing it publicly and regularly is abnormal....if you guys do that then you need serious counselling and if you are unhappy for no reason... a shrink can help you on that No one can tell you if you need a counselor and sometimes find a good counselor can be a new struggle of it's own.  I am a Life Coach and I have worked with families and individuals in your situation. I would be happy to talk to you, for free and no strings attached.  I could help you explore your options for a possible solution to your situation, as well as possibly provide referrals.  I have a Master's Degree in Counseling and also a Bachelor's in Psychology and would welcome an email at coach@moreauthenticlife.com  or you are also welcome to initiate chat with me.  Good luck and don't ignore an obvious problem.  You, your husband and your kids all deserve better.  Don't cheat yourself out of a happy family, it really does exist for some people! Feel free to contact me. Yes, definitely you all need to seek counseling. Just asking the question gives me the first clue. But the arguing and fighting could get worse if you do not seek help from an outsider that is qualified to help you and your family. Get counseling and take parenting classes, they really help! Counseling would be good, but also praying about it and finding a good Church for your family would be a great \"new\" start. Prayer is powerful, and you can do anything through Christ who strengthens you. Good luck, God Bless! yes indeed....a counseller is needed in each and every part of our life...however, we may do without it sometimes.\nas you have said, i strongly opine that you need a counceller. one best thing u can do before going to a counselor is to do meditation. try this one for a week. check out the results. u will find the difference",

    "answer": "Well, one if it was because of drinking, then your liver would hurt. I think you either have some form of upper resportatory infection, heartburn, or a chest cold. If I were you, I'd get that checked out. The question is - why do you think it's a pain in your heart?  It could be a pain coming from your lungs, or any of the other structures in the chest.  In case you're not aware, most pain from heart disease comes from the center of your chest. To get an accurate diagnosis from your symptoms, you'll need to tell the doctor more about the pain: e.g., when does the pain usually come on (when you're walking/running, when you're lying flat, in the middle of the night when you're sleeping, etc.), where in the chest it is, describe the type of pain (sharp, dull ache, pressure-sensation, etc.), does the pain appear to go to any other part of the body (like does it go down your left arm?), do you get short of breath when the pain comes on, and so on and so forth. The more you tell the doctor about the characteristics of the pain, the more likely the doctor will be able to diagnose the pain.",

About 3 hours after eating a normal meal,normal sugar levels should be around 120-150 for diabetics. They shouldnt go over 200mg dl,and should go back down under 120 with in about 3 hours.\nMost normal (non-diabetc) individuals dont really go above 135 mg dl.

Ask a doctor before running or lifting weights because if you have weak capillaries in your eyes or something,you can burst them and go blind. \nSupplements such as GTF Chromium at 200mg 3 times a day with meals have helped reduce sugar levels in some people,as well as vanadium(vanadyle sulfate), gymnema sylvestra, bean pod tea, blue berry extract, cinnamon,and many other herbs and vitamin supplements have been reported to aid in reducing sugar levels in some people.\nWork with you doctor in using these and other supplements,and drink plenty of water. fasting is around 90 and lower \n\n150 any other time unless u have high levels then your dr will tell u another number to aim for \n\nhope it helps",

THAT OUR \"WONDERFUL\"(NOTE SARCASIM) PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN US IN TO.... \n\nANY WAY HELL YEAH LEGALIZE..!!!! there is not enough reasons for it to be kept illegal. more so, it has a lot of medicinal benefits sure-legalization equals taxation. then we should tackle prostitution Even though I wouldn't smoke it even if it were legalized (I'm asthmatic) I wouldn't oppose its legalization as long as its use is restricted to adults who are not driving or operating dangerous machinery. I believe that marijuana usage can dangerously impair someone who is driving and should have the same restrictions that we currently have for alcoholic beverages.\n   By the way, I would never be in favor of legalizing drugs like cocaine, heroine, crystal methamphetamine or ecstasy unless they could be proven to have a medical benefit and be used under the supervision of physicians. No , because mostly who begins with Cannabis ; finish with Cocain . The problem lies within the governing of it. How does uncle Sam get a piece of the action? If it were to be legalized, people would grow it at home or in hiding like they do now. Who would buy it for a high taxed price when they can get it cheaper on the street? Absolutely!!!  No one has ever died using cannabis.  It has MANY medicinal benefits.  But we must hold a person accountable for his actions, even under the influence of cannabis.

    "question": "how do you get rid of the common cold?",
    "answer": "The common cold is primarily different varieties of viruses.  Viruses enter your body when your immune system has been weakened.  This could be due to a number of factors.  The most common is lack of rest.  If you do not receive the proper amount of sleep every night, your immune system is weakened.  \n\nThe best way (I have found) get rid of a cold is to get LOTS of rest, drink lots of oj (nonconcentrated), and drinking PLENTY of water.  Water helps to flush out all impurities in your body.  This has always helped me to recover quickly.\n\nAnother way to boost your immune system is to a daily mulit-vitman.  Make sure that it has B-12 in it as well.  B-12 is execellent for boosting and maintaining a healthy immune system. Zicam.  It really works.  \nIt is a zinc compound.\nI'm on my first cold of the season, I'm counting on Zicam to shorten it.\nI've avoided them so far using this.\nI think that the only reason this one got me is because I started on Zicam late as this cold manifested overnight. flush it out\ndrink as much water and juices with vitamic c as possible. A few years ago, a new natural product hit the market. It's called AIRBORNE and was developed by a second-grade teacher. It is amazing. It is best to take it when you first notice symptoms.  I have used it several times with excellent results. I have also given it to my family members and they too have had their \"cold time\" greatly reduced.\n\nI also take 1000 mg C in the morning and another dose 12 hours later.\n\nhttp://www.airbornehealth.com/main.html I go nuts with EmergenC (whatever your body doesn't need, it will flush out).  Also, since there's little else that can be done, I just pamper myself with yummy, tasty food, baths, movie rentals, etc...  If you absolutely have to stay home from work, treat it like a mini-vacation.  I seriously believe that eliminating stress and raising your happiness levels makes the cold go away faster. Let it be__It is only the miracle of the body eliminating excess. The worst you can do is to treat the symptom with medication as they will only stop the cleansing process leaving not only the excess but also the residual drug residue. Not a good thing to have your body deal with over the years. The best thing to do is nothing while allowing your body to use its Primary Intelligence  and heal itself Stay warm and away from the ill contacts. \nTake some decongestant and soothers.\nDrink some hot soup.\nwatch TV.\nEnjoy The common cold is caused by viruses. There's very little we can do against that. You just have to wait for the battle between your immune system and the virus to finish. Anything you can do to help your immune system would help though, like be careful not to get a second infection or catch anything bacterial, etc. Plenty of fluids and plenty of rest.

    "answer": "It might take a little getting used to because progressive lenses don't give you quite as big of a field of view in the center of the lens.  I don't think I've ever heard of a person not thinking that progressives were worth it.  If you aren't sold on the idea, another option is a trifocal, but you don't get quite the versatility with that as you do with a progressive.  A progressive will give you a wide range of close distances that you can see clearly and a trifocal will only give you 2.  Hope this helps. I wear progressive lenses and I think they are great.  They took some getting used to at first. I have progressive glasses and they work well, I found that I move my head a bit more in some instances than my other non progressive glasses (due to the lenses 3 areas of magnification). I originaly needed glasses to see distance and then as the years passed I found I was taking them off to read and holding the media closer. Now that I have the progressive glasses I wear them all the time and I am used to them, I hope this helps i wear progressive lenses. i hav found out recently though, that those can actually make ur eyes worse cuz its like a crutch and ur eyes get weak nd depend on it. i started doing eye exercises, maybe u should too. also look for a vision therapist",

If it is, and your hair is not growing then take the hint and stop putting that poison on your hair.\n\nSome people's hair can not withstand the harsh effects of relaxers, so it just stunts the hair growth.\n\nMe for example.  I stopped relaxing my hair, and it grew to the same length it took my hair to grow in a year in only 2 months.\n\nJust leave your hair be what it wants to be, and that's the way God made it.  Curly, bushy, free, and beautiful.\n\nAnd plus, when your hair is natural it is more versitile.  If you can't STAND the natural look, you can get it press and curled.  \n\nBut you can go from a sleek look, to a full beautiful fro in a matter of a day.  Guess who can't do that?  The people that black women today are trying to look like.\n\nThink about it sis. Though on the flip side my hair is relaxed and grows quite well..it is all in maintaining the relaxer, conditioning, getting regular trims, and seeing a stylist. I hope this helps!",

    "question": "What is Diptheria?",
    "answer": "Diphtheria is an upper respiratory tract illness characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent membrane of the tonsil(s), pharynx, and/or nose. A milder form of diphtheria can be limited to the skin. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, an aerobic Gram-positive bacterium.\n\nDiphtheria is a highly contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the secretions of those infected. Diphtheria was once quite common, but has now largely been eradicated in developed nations (in the United States for instance, there have been fewer than 5 cases a year reported since 1980, as the DPT (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine is given to all school children). Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nThe respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further.\n\nLow blood pressure may develop in some patients. Longer-term effects include cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy (sensory type)[1]. Diphtheria is a contagious illness caused by a type of bacteria. It can cause breathing and swallowing problems and can damage the heart and central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Diphtheria (dif-THEER-e-uh) is a serious bacterial infection, usually affecting the mucous membranes of your nose and throat. The disease typically causes a bad sore throat, fever, swollen glands and weakness. But the hallmark sign is a thick, gray covering in the back of your throat that can make breathing difficult. Diphtheria can also infect your skin.\n\nSigns and symptoms of diphtheria may include:\n\nA sore throat and hoarseness \nPainful swallowing \nSwollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes) in your neck \nA thick, gray membrane covering your throat and tonsils \nDifficulty breathing or rapid breathing \nNasal discharge \nFever and chills \nMalaise \n\nFor more infor please visit this URL: Choose Diptheria.",

    "answer": "MRSA is a bacteria that does not usually effect most healthy people. It is a bacteria that is resistant to most antibiotics, however there are stronger antibiotics that can cure it. It can be fatal to people who have compromised immune systems, and are usually put in isolation until 3 cultures come back negative. You can get MRSA on the skin which is very painful bumps with puss that when popped make more painful bumps with puss, it can also be found in body fluids such as urine, sputum, and blood. When they test to see if a person may be a carrier of MRSA, they usually swab the person's nose. I am sure you can find out more at the CDC (center for disease control) website. Beyond what good info KDbowlin said, she's right. Check the CDC website. But also remember MRSA can be very contagious as all staph is.  My mother contracted it after having a cancerous spot removed on her leg.  Dirty doc's office.  It became worse than her recovery from cancer, which is now fine.  It took three rounds of anti's to nail the staph and it produced a big nasty wound.  So if you have it, get on it, goto the doc at once and get it tested and treated.  And don't touch it and spread it around or touch another if you touch yourself first.  Be careful and stay healthy if you have it.  \nStrengthen your immunity with zinc, vit. C and other anti-oxidants from brightly colored foods and increase your protein because protein is needed for cellular and muscular repair.

    "question": "what are the important effects of greeg tea?",
    "answer": "All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.\n\nWhat does EGCG do?\nResearch has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, \u201cWe have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.\u201d The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.\n\nIt's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.\n\nIn short - it's good for you! as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic. \njust about anything green/fruits/vegetables  helps us this way. Green tea also has a lot of antioxidants",

Unlike black and oolong teas, green tea is not fermented, preserving its active constituents, notably the polyphenolic antioxidant EGCG. Research suggests that EGCG in green tea contributes to cardiovascular health, boosts the immune system, and may inhibit the enzyme DHFR, a target for anti-cancer drugs. Despite numerous claims about green tea's health benefits, not all are scientifically substantiated due to ongoing research. In general, green tea is lauded for reducing bad cholesterol, offering an alkalizing effect on the body, in contrast to coffee's acidity, and providing a rich source of antioxidants."

    "question": "I recently found a lump in my breast.?",
    "answer": "You have not mentioned your age. Better consult your doctor. It requires further investigations. If you are truly concerned, consider getting a second opinion from a doctor of your own choosing, NOT one that's been recommended by the doc that gave you the first reading.  That way you know there are no conflicting interests.\n\nSometimes a lump is just a lump.  Breasts get lumpy during certain times of the month, and goes along with normal cycles.  Calcifications and shadowing are pretty routine findings as well.  If there was something to be concerned about, the first doc would have ordered a biopsy on the lump.  A biopsy is where a needle is inserted into the lump and a sample is taken to be studied, to determine whether it is cancerous. This same time last year I was experiencing the same thing.  No one was ever really sure what the lump was but it wasn't cancerous.  I even had a biopsy after the ultrasound and mammogram showed nothing.  Perhaps your doctor will schedule one for you.  And if nothing still shows up they will schedule you for another ultrasound in six months.\nI've had my six month check up, and I'm happy to say IT'S STILL NOTHING!!\nI wish you the best.\nBe blessed!! My best friend has calcifictions. Has had them for years. She is fine. I have had 3 lumps. All were nothing. 99% of breast \"abnormalities\" (actually not that abnormal) are NOT CANCER. If you have been screened, and still feel concerned, get a second opinion. #1 thing, don't worry. Worry causes more cancer than breast lumps do. Try excercising to help reduce worry (it really works!)\n\nI have a lump right now. Needle biopsy says it is not cancer, my doctors all say it is not cancer and I am not worrying about it. I have some of the best doctors in the country. Lumps happen.\n\nExercise to reduce worry! It really helps.",

However, morning sickness usually begins around the sixth week and fluttering feelings within the abdomen can usually be felt around the 16-20th week. I have had 3 children and with all of them I felt sick and ill about a week before I missed a period.    but it all depends on the individual. It depends on each individual. With my first pregnancy, I knew the day after I got pregnant, because I had morning sickness every day of my pregnancy. Once I delivered, the sickness stopped! Each of my pregnancies were different, and had their own uniqueness. That's a hard question to answer with a general idea. If you show no symptoms early on, and have no tummy bulge, then it may take you up to 4 1/2 months to know, because by then, you will feel the baby moving in your tummy. Some people keep having periods during pregnancy, so they may not even realize it for months! Good luck. I know it sounds crazy....but I felt like I was pregnant 2 days after conception.  I just knew.  Not because I had any weird symptoms, it was just like all of a sudden, I new I wasn't alone anymore.  I haven't been since. the day after to 8 weeks into the pregnancy you'll start to feel like your pregnant.",

    "question": "what is an aflatoxin?",
    "answer": "PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI\n\n\nReddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n\nNatural occurrence:\n\nFood products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties:\n\nAflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans.

    "answer": "You are on the right track. It relies on inductive charging:\n<quote>\nIf you own an electric toothbrush, there's a good chance that it has a completely sealed toothbrush unit. The toothbrush rests on the charger without any metal contacts to connect the toothbrush to the base. This has the great advantage of allowing the toothbrush to be completely sealed so that water cannot enter through exposed contacts. It also avoids any problems with water getting into the contacts and shorting out the charger.\n\nThis sort of sealed arrangement is called inductive charging. Essentially, the toothbrush and the base form a two-part transformer, with the base having one part of the transformer and the toothbrush having the other. When you slide the toothbrush onto the base, the complete transformer is created and charge can flow.\n\nThe base contains one of the coils and the metal bar. The toothbrush contains the second coil.

Core body temperature is the temperature of the blood as it is pumped from the heart, which normally ranges from 99 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Extended periods of sauna or whirlpool exposures or prolonged vigorous exercise may actually cause this temperature to rise. This rise in body temperature could result in developmental damage or possibly death to the fetus.

If you walk into school tomorrow and instead of complaining about your braces or trying to hide them, just smile and talk with your friends and don't worry about them.  You will be surprised that most people will not even notice them.  And even if they do, enough other people have braces, they will get used to your slightly changed appearance in a couple of days.  \nDo see what your Ortho recommends for pain for the first few days - it will help you feel better and make it easier to talk and eat without pain.  Also take a toothbrush to school and brush your teeth after lunch so that you don't have unsightly food stuck in them.  This also has the added benefit of preventing white spots on your teeth when the braces are removed.\nRemember, it could be much worse, you could have had to have top and bottom braces or head gear or any of the other innumerable more obvious appliances.\nOn a personal note, I had braces (top & bottom, metal) from 6th grade until 12th grade and I can't remember anyone ever making a disparaging comment about them and they certainly didn't hurt my dating life! there transpent? dont worry..im 14 and have the visable train track ones..i don't care...just keep them clean! and smile! :-D",

You don't have to have a prescription to get the otc ones & they usually are not so awfully expensive! Good Luck!! I have to say that Centrum and well as the Mega Man/Woman Series of vitimans from GNC are absorbed very well.  Also if you contact there customer service departments I am sure they can provide you with dissolution tests to prove absorption rates. The best multi-vitamins are in liquid form.  I cannot even take tablets.  The chemicals in them make me very nauseaus.  Vitamins in liquid form are easily absorbed and get into your system faster.\n\nMy Naturopath told me a story about one of her clients...\n\nShe was having her holding tank for her toilet sewage drained.

    "question": "What is multiple sclerosis?",
    "answer": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.\n\nThe exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.\n\nThe inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).\n\nRecurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.\n\nResearchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.\n\nPeople with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.\n\nCheck out this article with excellent illustrations:\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) - that's the brain and spinal cord. Predominantly, it is a disease of the \"white matter\" tissue. The white matter is made up of nerve fibres which are responsible for transmitting communication signals both internally within the CNS and between the CNS and the nerves supplying rest of the body.

    "question": "what is thephysiology of thirst?",
    "answer": "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n\nThirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted.",

Thirst sensation is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, triggered by dehydration, leading to antidiuretic hormone release and signaling to drink and limit water excretion. Thirst is related to the salt concentration in the blood, and feeling thirsty indicates approximately 1% dehydration."
